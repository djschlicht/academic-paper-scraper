The role of host phenology for parasite transmission

Abstract
Phenology is a fundamental determinant of species distributions, abundances, and interactions. In host–parasite interactions, host phenology can affect parasite fitness due to the temporal constraints it imposes on host contact rates. However, it remains unclear how parasite transmission is shaped by the wide range of phenological patterns observed in nature. We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi. Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period. Surprisingly, B. burgdorferi is eradicated if the larval activity period begins long after the end of nymphal activity due to a feedback with mouse population dynamics. These results highlight the importance of phenology, a common driver of species interactions, for the fitness of a parasite.

Introduction
Behaviors or traits that vary seasonally, termed phenology in the ecological literature, impact both the type and strength of ecological interactions within populations and communities (Miller-Rushing et al. 2010; Bewick et al. 2016; Paull and Johnson 2014; Barber et al. 2016; Burkett-Cadena et al. 2011). For example, seasonal matching between flowering times and pollinator activity periods is a key driver of short- and long-term population dynamics of both plants and insects (Cleland et al. 2007; Gaku et al. 2004; Inouye 2008; Kudo and Ida 2013; Memmott et al. 2007; Hegland et al. 2009). Differences in the seasonal activities of interacting species over time or geography, caused by changes in climatic and environmental features, can result in population extinctions and in population explosions (Cahill et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2010; Washburn and Cornell 1981; Powell and Bentz 2009; Jepsen et al. 2009; van Asch and Visser 2007; Jepsen et al. 2008). Although the majority of studies focus on the phenology of plants and their interacting species, the seasonal activity of hosts or disease vectors is also likely to have large impacts on the population dynamics of infectious microbes.The impact of phenology on disease transmission dynamics can be prominent in disease systems involving multiple host species or life stages because the seasonal match or mismatch of activities between species or stages will determine the frequency and type of pathogen transmission. For instance, consider the cestode Schistocephalus solidus that infects young three-spined stickleback fish as an intermediate host, multiplies within the fish before the fish is eaten by the definitive bird host (belted kingfisher) (Clarke 1954; Heins et al. 2016). The parasite reproduces sexually within the bird who defecate parasite eggs that infect juvenile fish (Clarke 1954). This disease system occurs in North American lakes that freeze over winter, causing both fish reproduction and bird migration to be temporally restricted within each year. A temporal mismatch in the bird and fish phenologies, such as fish reproduction occurring prior to the return migration of birds, could therefore reduce or eliminate cestode transmission among its hosts. Further, variation in the environmental cues affecting the seasonal activity patterns of the birds and fish either among lakes or across years is likely to impact disease transmission dynamics. These types of seasonal dynamics are expected to impact parasite fitness in many disease systems, yet the quantitative and qualitative impact of phenology remains relatively under explored (Barber et al. 2016).Human diseases caused by zoonotic pathogens, those that complete their natural life cycle in wildlife but can infect humans, are likely impacted by the phenology of their wildlife hosts or vectors. Parasites transmitted by hard bodied ticks (family Ixodidae) represent a practical case study to examine the impact of phenology on disease systems. The public health importance of diseases transmitted by these ticks, such as Lyme disease, has resulted in expansive field datasets that provide baseline expectations for the transmission consequences of tick phenological patterns, making this a good system to study the effects of the general conceptual issue of how vector phenology drives parasite transmission (Randolph 1999b; Randolph et al. 2000; Ogden et al. 2018). Ixodid ticks have three distinct developmental stages. Larvae, the first developmental stage, hatch uninfected but can acquire Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, while feeding on an infected host (Fig. 1). Fed larvae molt to nymphs that can then transmit B. burgdorferi to small vertebrate hosts (primarily mice, chipmunks, and shrews) during nymphal feeding. Fed nymphs molt to adults that feed on large vertebrates before laying eggs that hatch as larvae. In the Northeastern USA, the nymphal stage is active in early summer while larvae from a different cohort feed in late summer, providing an opportunity for B. burgdorferi transmission from nymphs to larvae through the vertebrate hosts (Wilson and Spielman 1985). This sequential feeding pattern has been alleged to contribute to higher infection prevalence found in the Northeastern USA relative to Southern or Midwestern USA, where the sequential activity patterns are less pronounced (Ogden et al. 2018; Brinkerhoff et al. 2011).Here we develop a model to study the evolutionary ecology of parasite transmission given different phenological scenarios using the B. burgdorferi–Ixodes tick system as a natural example. The relative simplicity of our model makes mathematical analyses tractable while capturing the fundamental impact of phenology on parasite fitness. This impact unfolds over two timescales: the within-season dynamics of infection and the between-season demography of the vector (Bewick et al. 2016). Previous work (Dunn et al. 2013; Ogden et al. 2004) considered the within-season dynamics of infection but did not account for the between-season population dynamics of the vector species. The latter is an important factor as phenology can alter vector population sizes resulting in an ecological feedback impacting parasite fitness. Our analysis builds on a modeling framework that integrates these effects (Bewick et al. 2016) and demonstrates a general approach for studying both the short- and long-term impacts of vector phenology for parasite fitness. We use the Lyme disease system to describe our approach, although the modeling framework applies to all parasites that require multiple transmission events to complete their life cycle (e.g., West Nile Virus, Leishmania parasites, Yersinia pestis). Our framework can be extended to study how specific vector life history traits, such as differential mortality throughout the year, impact parasite fitness. Additionally, our straightforward framework makes further investigation of the evolutionary pressure imposed by phenology possible.

Model
We model the transmission of B. burgdorferi between I. scapularis and a main vertebrate reservoir, the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus (LoGiudice et al. 2003). Our model tracks the within-season dynamics of nymphal and larval population activity and uses these dynamics to compute the between-season changes in overall infection prevalence.Fig. 1How does tick life-stage phenology impact the transmission of B. burgdorferi? (a.) Larval ticks hatch uninfected (Piesman et al. 1986; Patrican 1997) and can acquire B. burgdorferi by feeding on an infected small animal (I). Fed infected larvae molt to nymphs and become active the following year (II). Small animals are infected when fed upon by an infected nymph (III). Fed nymphs molt to adults and feed on larger animals prior to laying eggs that hatch the following year (IV). Adult ticks play a minor role in the transmission ecology of B. burgdorferi and are thus not explicitly modeled. Equations describe transitions between tick life stages and infection status from the modeling framework. (b.) The seasonal activity patterns of the tick developmental stages vary from near-continuous activity of all stages throughout the year (i) (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2006; Ogden et al. 2018) to developmental stages with temporally divergent activity seasons of short-duration within the USA (iii) (Diuk-Wasser et al. 2006; Ogden et al. 2018). This latter tick-stage phenology (iii) is thought to result in high transmission of B. burgdorferi as large proportions of hosts are infected by nymphs (III) prior to larval activity (I). Black lines show larval activity, and gray lines show nymphal activity. Note that the larvae and nymphs that feed in the same summer are from different cohortsFull size imageWithin-season dynamics describe the duration of nymphal and larval emergence and feeding activity in continuous time from the beginning of each season (\(t=0\)) to the end (\(t=\tau\)). The life cycle we model is depicted in Figure 1a. Ticks start their life cycle uninfected, but may pick up the infection as larvae by feeding on an infected mouse (Magnarelli et al. 1987). Larvae then overwinter and emerge as nymphs in the next season who can transmit the infection to new mice who are also born uninfected (Hofmeister et al. 1999). The state variables \(L_\bullet (t)\), \(N_\bullet (t)\), and \(M_\bullet (t)\) represent larval, nymphal, and mouse populations, where the subscripts denote the host-seeking status of ticks (q for questing for a host or f for fed), as well as infection status of ticks and mice (i for infected, u for uninfected). Thus, \(L_{q}\) denotes the questing larvae (who by definition cannot be infected), while \(L_{if}\) denotes fed larvae that are infected. We make the common assumption that mortality and vital rates for both ticks and mice are not impacted by their infection status (Schwanz et al. 2011; Gage et al. 1995). The total mouse population size is \(M = M_{i} + M_{u}\). The within-season dynamics are given by the following system of ordinary differential equations: $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dL_{q}}{dt}&= \hat{L}(T)g_{l}\left( t,l_{l}\right) -L_{q}\left( \gamma _{l}M +\mu _{l}\right) , \end{aligned}$$
                    (1a)
                $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dL_{if}}{dt}&= \beta _{ml}\gamma _{l}L_{q}M_{i},\end{aligned}$$

                $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dL_{uf}}{dt}&= \gamma _{l}L_{q}\left( M_{u}+\left( 1-\beta _{ml}\right) M_{i}\right) ,\end{aligned}$$
                    (1c)
                $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dN_{iq}}{dt}&= \hat{N}_{i}(T)g_{n}\left( t,l_{n}\right) -N_{iq}\left( \gamma _{n}M+\mu _{n}\right) ,\end{aligned}$$

                Here, \(\hat{L}(T)\) represents the total larval population to emerge in year T, as determined by the number of nymphs that have successfully fed in the previous year, \(T-1\), survived to adulthood, and reproduced (given by equation (18) below). Similarly, \(\hat{N}_{i}(T)\) and \(\hat{N}_{u}(T)\) represent the total number of questing infected and uninfected nymphs that emerge in year T as determined by the number of infected and uninfected larvae at the end of the previous year and the probability of over-winter survival (see equations (16) and (17)). All other parameters are described in Table 1.The functions \(g_{l}(t,l_{l})\) and \(g_{l}(t,l_{n})\) are probability density functions describing the timing and length of larval and nymphal emergence, respectively. We describe tick emergence using a uniform distribution for analytical tractability:$$\begin{aligned} g_\bullet (t,l_\bullet ) = {\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \quad 0 \quad t \le t_{\bullet 0} \\ \frac{1}{l_\bullet } \: \: t_{\bullet 0}\le t \le t_{\bullet f} \\ \quad 0 \quad t_{\bullet f} \le t \end{array}\right. } \end{aligned}$$where \(t_{\bullet 0}\) is the time emergence begins, \(t_{\bullet f}\) is the time emergence stops and \(l_\bullet\) is the length of the emergence period (\(t_{\bullet f}-t_{\bullet 0}=l_\bullet\)). The uniform distribution establishes a constant emergence probability for ticks over \(l_\bullet\) and thus spreads the emergence of the tick cohort evenly across the emergence period from \(t_{\bullet f}< t < t_{\bullet 0}\). While our analysis relies on tick emergence following a uniform distribution, we conducted numerical simulations when tick emergence follows a Gamma distribution and found that the shape of the distribution does not qualitatively change our results (Appendix E.)Equations (1a-1h) reduce to the following set of equations if we assume that the host population is at equilibrium, \(\left( M = k \left( 1-\frac{\mu _{m}}{b}\right) \right)\): $$\begin{aligned} \frac{dL_{q}}{dt}&= \hat{L}(T)g_{l}\left( t,l_{l}\right) -L_{q}\left( \gamma _{l}M+\mu _{l}\right) ,\end{aligned}$$

                Table 1 Model parameters and their respective values. Time is measured in days for all parametersFull size tableWe solve equations (2a-2g) analytically in Appendix B.Between-season dynamicsThe within-season dynamics described above are coupled to recurrence equations that describe the survival of larvae and nymphs between years. We do not follow the mouse population between years because the impact of overwintering infected mice on B. burgdorferi transmission is thought to be negligible (Bunikis et al. 2004; Anderson et al. 1987). The total number of infected and uninfected nymphs (\(\hat{N}_{i}(T+1)\) and \(\hat{N}_{u}(T+1)\)) that emerge in a given year are given as a function of the number of infected and uninfected fed larvae at the end of the previous year (\(L_{if}(\tau )\) and \(L_{uf}(\tau )\)) as follows:$$\begin{aligned} \hat{N}_{i}(T+1)&= \sigma _{l}L_{if}(\tau ),\end{aligned}$$
                    (3)
                $$\begin{aligned} \hat{N}_{u}(T+1)&= \sigma _{l}L_{uf}(\tau ) \end{aligned}$$
                    (4)
                where \(L_{if}(\tau )\) and \(L_{uf}(\tau )\) are the infected and uninfected larval abundances at the end of the previous season (see Appendix B) and \(\sigma _{l}\) is the larval overwintering survival probability.Similarly, the total fed nymphal population at the end of the year \(N_{f}(\tau )\) gives rise to the population of larvae, \(\hat{L}(T+1)\), that emerges the following year as described by the map:$$\begin{aligned} \hat{L}(T+1) = \frac{\sigma _{n}N_{f}(\tau )}{1+\alpha N_{f}(\tau )} \end{aligned}$$
                    (5)
                where \(N_{f}(\tau )\) is found by integrating (1e) over the season from (0, \(\tau\)) as shown in Appendix B. \(\sigma _{n}\) is the expected number of eggs produced per fed nymph, after accounting for survival to adulthood and for fecundity. The strength of density dependence on reproduction is determined by \(\alpha\).With these functions, we can write the discrete, between-season mapping of the total larval and nymphal abundances from one year to the next:$$\begin{aligned} \hat{L}(T+1)&= \frac{\sigma _{n}\phi _{n}\hat{N}(T)}{1+\alpha \phi _{n}\hat{N}(T)}, \end{aligned}$$

                $$\begin{aligned} \hat{N}_{i}(T+1)&= \sigma _{l}\phi _{li}\left( \hat{N}_{i}(T)\right) \hat{L}(T),\end{aligned}$$
                    (7)
                $$\begin{aligned} \hat{N}_{u}(T+1)&= \sigma _{l}\phi _{lu}\left( \hat{N}_{i}(T)\right) \hat{L}(T) \end{aligned}$$
                    (8)
                where \(\phi _{n}\) denotes the fraction of emerging nymphs that successfully feed as calculated from within-season dynamics (\(\phi _{n}=\frac{N_{f}(\tau )}{\hat{N}(T)}\); see Appendix A), and \(\phi _{li}\left( \hat{N}_{i}(T)\right)\) and \(\phi _{lu}\left( \hat{N}_{i}(T)\right)\) are functions of \(\hat{N}_{i}(T)\) that denote the fraction of emerging larvae that become infected or remain uninfected through feeding as calculated from within-season dynamics (e.g., \(\phi _{li}\left( \hat{N}_{i}(T)\right) =\frac{L_{if}(\tau )}{\hat{L}(T)}\); see Appendix B).We next calculate the basic reproductive number, \(R_{0}\), to quantify the impact of phenology for B. burgdorferi fitness. \(R_{0}\) represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infected tick in an otherwise naïve population of mice and ticks (McCallum 2001), which gives the threshold for parasite invasibility given the phenology of both tick stages. \(R_{0}\) is computed as the number of infected nymphs that emerge in year \(T + 1\) produced by a single infected nymph that emerged in year T in an otherwise uninfected population. Specifically, we consider a tick population that is at its demographic equilibrium without the infection, solved by setting \(\hat{L}^*=\hat{L}(T)\), \(\hat{N}^*=\hat{N}_{u}(T)-1\), and \(\hat{N}_{i}(T)=1\) in equations (20)- (21). At this demographic equilibrium, \(R_0\) of a rare parasite infection is given as follows:$$\begin{aligned} R_{0}=\frac{\hat{N}_{i}(T+1)}{\hat{N}_{i}(T)}=\sigma _{l}\phi _{li}\left( \hat{N}_{i}\right) \hat{L}^* \end{aligned}$$
                    (9)
                This \(R_{0}\) accounts for transmission between cohorts of ticks through intermediate mouse hosts in a given feeding season. When \({\hat{N}_{i}(T)} = 1\), parasites persist in phenological scenarios where \(\hat{N}_{i}((T+1))\ge 1\) (i.e., slope is greater than or equal to unity). Details of the analytical approach are in Appendix C.

Results
The rate of B. burgdorferi transmission from nymphs to mice to larvae is low in systems where either nymphs or larvae are continuously active (Fig. 2). Controlling for total population sizes, when nymphal feeding is evenly spread throughout the year, few nymphs feed at any given time, resulting in limited nymph-to-mouse transmission events. The proportion of infected mice remains constantly low as new infections occur at a similar rate as mouse mortality which replaces older, potentially infected mice with uninfected juveniles. Larval ticks rarely encounter infected mice, thus limiting mouse-to-tick transmission events. By contrast, seasonal nymphal activity concentrates nymph-to-mouse transmission events in time, causing a seasonal peak in mouse infection prevalence that decays due to mouse population turnover (Fig. 2). The duration of the nymphal activity period is negatively correlated with the rate at which infected mice accumulate as well as the maximum mouse infection prevalence (e.g., small \(l_{n}\) values in Fig. 2). That is, nymphal activity periods of greater duration result in a lower maximum mouse infection prevalence that peaks later in the season (Fig. 2). Larval ticks that feed at or around the peak in mouse infection prevalence are more likely to encounter an infected mouse and to acquire B. burgdorferi before molting to nymphs.Fig. 2Concentrated nymphal emergence durations (\(l_{n} = 15\) days, A) result in a higher and earlier mouse infection prevalence peak (B) compared to longer nymphal emergence durations (\(l_{n} = 60\) days) for the same total tick population sizes. For example, a nymphal activity duration of 15 days (\(l_{n} = 15\) days, A) results in peak mouse infection prevalence (B) occurring on day 15, while \(l_{n} = 60\) days results in peak mouse infection prevalence occurring on day 61. In both models, \(25\%\) of emerging nymphs are infected, \(k = 50, M = k(1 - \mu _{m}/b) = 45\). All other parameter values are shown in Table 1Full size imageThe fitness of B. burgdorferi, quantified by the basic reproductive number (\(R_{0}\)), is greatest when larval activity is concentrated around the peak in the mouse infection prevalence, thus increasing the probability that each larva will feed on an infected mouse (Fig. 3A. and Fig. 4A). Larvae that are active long after the end of the nymphal activity period are likely to feed on an uninfected mouse due to decays in mouse infection prevalence caused by mouse population turnover (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4B). Similarly, larval activity periods that begin prior to nymphal activity periods result in the majority of larvae feeding on uninfected mice that have not acquired an infection from a feeding nymph.Fig. 3The basic reproductive number, \(R_{0}\), of B. burgdorferi is greatest when larval activity is concentrated around peak mouse infection prevalence. The left panel depicts \(R_{0}\) as a function of the duration of larval emergence (\(l_{l}\)) and time between nymphal and larval emergence (\(t_{l0}\)). Panels on the right depict within-season dynamics for representative timing parameter values indicated by their respective letters on the left panel. (A) Concentrated larval emergence (small \(l_{l}\)) that begins slightly after nymphal emergence (\(20<t_{l0}<35\)) increases the probability that questing larvae feed on mice recently infected by nymphs (\(t_{l0} = 25, l_{l} = 18\)). (B) Transmission decreases as larvae emerge later (\(t_{l0}>35\)) because the larval cohort feeds after peak mouse infection prevalence (\(t_{l0} = 50, l_{l} = 18\)). (C) When larval and nymphal emergence is more synchronous (small \(t_{l0}\)), transmission to larvae increases as larval emergence duration increases (large \(l_{l}\)) because more larvae feed after infectious nymphs (\(t_{l0} = 5, l_{l} = 40\)). B. burgdorferi is not maintained in systems where \(R_{0}<1\). \(R_{0}\) is calculated assuming tick emergence is uniformly distributed (\(U(l_{l})\) where \(l_{l}\) is the larval emergence duration, see Appendix C). \(\hat{L} = \hat{L}^*, \hat{N}_{i} = 1, \hat{N}_{u} = \hat{N}^* - 1\) (see Appendix A.) \(l_{n} = 25\) days; all other parameter values are shown in Table 1Full size imageThe effect of larval emergence duration depends on whether or not larval emergence coincides with nymphal emergence: concentrated larval emergence decreases \(R_{0}\) when larval and nymphal emergence periods are synchronous (Fig. 5) because most larvae feed before nymphs have a chance to infect the mouse population. Conversely, concentrated larval emergence tends to increase \(R_{0}\) when larvae emerge later than nymphs (Fig. 6). This occurs because nymphal emergence that slightly precedes larval emergence results in high mouse infection prevalence when larvae begin emerging (Fig. 6A), and concentrated emergence results in most larvae feeding when the prevalence of infection is still high. In both cases, \(R_{0}\) decreases with very broad larval emergence due to mouse turnover (Fig. 3C, Fig. 4C, Fig. 6B, Fig. 5B).Fig. 4The basic reproductive number, \(R_{0}\), of B. burgdorferi is greatest when larval emergence begins shortly after nymphal emergence such that larvae feed during peak mouse infection prevalence. The left panel depicts \(R_0\) as a function of the time between the start of nymphal and larval emergence (\(t_{l0}\)) and the duration of the nymphal emergence period (\(l_{n}\)). The letters within the left panel indicate the parameter values used to depict representative within-season dynamics in the right panels. (A) Concentrated nymphal emergence (small \(l_{n}\)) coupled with slight differences in nymphal and larval emergence time (\(t_{l0}<10\)) increases the probability that questing larvae feed on mice infected by nymphs (\(t_{l0} = 10, l_{n} = 10\)). (B) Longer durations between nymphal and larval emergence time (\(t_{l0}>10\)) result in lower mouse-to-larvae transmission rates as many mice infected by nymphs die and are replaced by mice born uninfected such that larvae are likely to feed on uninfected mice (\(t_{l0} = 40, l_{n} = 10\)). (C) Synchronous emergence (\(t_{l0}=0\)) can also reduce B. burgdorferi fitness when nymphal emergence duration is long (large \(l_{n}\)) as many larvae feed before mice become infected by nymphs (\(t_{l0} = 5, l_{n} = 30\)). \(R_{0}\) is calculated assuming tick emergence is uniformly distributed (\(U(l_{n})\) where \(l_{n}\) is nymphal emergence length, see Appendix C). \(l_{l}=25, \hat{L} = \hat{L}^*, \hat{N}_{i} = 1, \hat{N}_{u} = \hat{N}^* - 1\) (see Appendix A). All other parameter values are shown in Table 1Full size imageFig. 5The larval emergence duration that maximizes \(R_{0}\) for B. burgdorferi is conditioned on nymphal emergence duration. \(R_{0}\) is high if larval emergence duration is slightly longer than nymphal emergence duration (\(l_{l} > l_{n}\) in (A) and (B)), thus allowing larvae to feed on mice that were previously fed upon by nymphs. However, \(R_{0}\) decreases when larval emergence duration is much longer than nymphal emergence duration (\(R_{0}\) of (B) \(< R_{0}\) of (A)) as late emerging larvae can feed on uninfected mice born after the nymphal activity period. Transmission from mice to larvae is low when the larval emergence duration is less than the nymphal emergence duration (\(l_{l} < l_{n}\) in (C)) because many larvae feed before infectious nymphs. B. burgdorferi is not maintained in systems where \(R_{0}<1\). \(R_{0}\) is calculated assuming tick emergence is uniformly distributed (\(U(l_{l})\) where \(l_{l}\) is the larval emergence length. See Appendix C for details). \(\hat{L} = \hat{L}^*\), \(\hat{N}^*\) = \(\hat{N}_{u}\) - 1 (see Appendix A). \(t_{l0}=0\), (A) \(l_{l} = 35, l_{n} = 7\) (B) \(l_{l} = 48, l_{n} = 10\) (C) \(l_{l} = 20, l_{n} = 30\). \(t_{l0} = 0\) days; all other parameter values are shown in Table 1Full size imageFig. 6Highly concentrated larval emergence increases \(R_{0}\) when larvae emerge slightly after nymphs. (A) Concentrated nymphal emergence drives high mouse infection prevalence and results in high transmission to larvae when larval emergence is tightly concentrated (\(l_{l} = 15, l_{n} = 15\)). (B) Transmission from mice to larvae decreases as larval emergence duration increases because larvae are more likely to feed on uninfected mice born after nymphal activity (\(l_{l} = 40, l_{n} = 15\)).

Discussion
Phenology is a fundamental component of all ecological interactions. Interactions between organisms such as competition, predation, and parasitism are predicated on temporal overlap of interacting species or life stages. Similarly, host or vector phenology impacts parasite fitness by temporally structuring transmission events between interacting hosts or life stages. Host or vector phenological patterns can even determine whether a pathogen is highly abundant or is unable to persist (Fig. 3). The ubiquity of seasonal activity among hosts and vectors, as well as the geographic variation in seasonal activity patterns, underscores the importance of phenology for the distribution and abundance of many pathogenic microbes including malaria, rabies, tapeworm, and Lyme disease (Hoshen and Morse 2004; Gremillion-Smith and Woolf 1988; Anderson 1974; Ogden et al. 2018). Here we derive the basic reproductive number, \(R_{0}\), for a transmission dynamics model that explicitly considers the impact of phenology on both parasite transmission and vector demography to assess the impact of vector phenology on parasite transmission and fitness using the Lyme disease system as an example. Our results are benchmarked by field data that show a link between the regional differences in tick phenology and differences in B. burgdorferi distribution and abundance (Ogden et al. 2018). Investigation of parameter space in this model revealed the novel insight that large temporal differences between the activity periods of tick life stages decrease B. burgdorferi fitness.Our model accounts for an important ecological feedback between vector demography and parasite fitness by incorporating the impact of phenology on demography. This is achieved by capturing both within-season infection dynamics and between-season vector demography in our mathematical analysis. Tick population sizes increase with earlier and more concentrated emergence because most ticks have sufficient time to successfully find a host before the season ends. By contrast, late or less concentrated emergence results in fewer ticks feeding before the season ends as the time available for later-emerging ticks to find a host is effectively shortened. The impact of this demographic feedback is limited at high mouse density but increases rapidly at low mouse density (see Appendix D). Extensions to this framework where vector mortality or contact rates with hosts vary throughout the year are likely to exacerbate the impact of phenology on demography. These results suggest that disregarding between-season demographic dynamics could underestimate parasite fitness (\(R_{0}\)) when ticks emerge early and overestimate \(R_{0}\) when ticks emerge later. The importance of this ecological feedback is reflected in the finding from a next-generation model focusing on within-season (but not between-season) impacts of tick phenology on B. burgdorferi fitness which indicated that vector demography is one of the most important model parameters affecting \(R_{0}\) (Dunn et al. 2013).Parasite fitness is maximized when the activity periods of vector life stages are of short duration (Fig. 2). Continuous nymphal activity temporally distributes the finite number of nymph-to-mouse transmission events such that mice become infected at a low rate throughout the season. Mouse infection prevalence remains continually low because mice that die, including infected mice, are replaced by uninfected juveniles at rates similar to the rate at which new infections are introduced. Mouse-to-larvae transmission events are similarly rare as most larvae feed on the relatively abundant uninfected mice. By contrast, seasonal nymphal activity concentrates nymph-to-mouse transmission events leading to many new mouse infections over a short period of time. Mouse infection prevalence increases rapidly during the nymphal activity period, as new infections occur at a much greater rate than mouse mortality, and subsequently decline when new infections stop at the end of the nymphal activity period (Fig. 2). Transmission from mice to larvae is very high if larval activity coincides with high mouse infection prevalence (Fig. 3A. and Fig. 4A.) The temporal concentration of infected hosts is likely to have important consequences for the transmission success and fitness of most pathogens (Altizer et al. 2006; Martinez 2018).Extended periods between nymphal and larval activity result in limited transmission efficiency (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4B). This novel prediction for the Lyme disease system is caused by the decay in mouse infection prevalence following nymphal activity due to mouse mortality and the birth of uninfected mice (Hofmeister et al. 1999; Wright et al. 1990). Thus, larvae feeding long after the nymphal activity period have a greater probability of feeding on uninfected mice than those that feed shortly after the nymphal activity period. While high mouse turnover is the norm in this system (Schug et al. 1991), lower mouse turnover would extend the period of high mouse infection prevalence and moderate the declines in parasite fitness caused by extended periods between larval and nymphal emergence.Parasite fitness is predicted to be greatest when all individuals within each developmental stage feed simultaneously and larvae feed immediately after nymphs. This result relies on the assumption that there is no limit to the number of ticks that can feed on a mouse at any given time. Realistically, the number of ticks per mouse is limited by grooming and foraging behaviors. Incorporating a maximum number of ticks per mouse will alter the prediction that simultaneous emergence within life stages maximizes parasite fitness as most ticks will fail to find an available host, resulting in fewer fed ticks each year and thus a lower \(R_{0}\). Further, accounting for spatial aggregation of host-seeking larvae would increase the impact of a maximum number of ticks per mouse (Ostfeld et al. 1996c, a, 2018; Devevey and Brisson 2012). Incorporating this ecological realism will cause intermediate emergence concentrations to result in more infected larvae.The observed fitness of B. burgdorferi in different Lyme disease foci in North America corresponds qualitatively with model predictions. For example, the relatively continuous activity of both tick developmental stages in the Southeastern USA has been proposed as a factor leading to the relatively low B. burgdorferi fitness observed in the region. In the Midwestern USA, where larvae and nymphs are synchronously active during a limited period, B. burgdorferi transmission is lower than in the Northeastern USA but much greater than where both stages are more continuously active (Fig. 5) (Hamer et al. 2012). The correlation between B. burgdorferi fitness observed in nature and the expected fitness differences given the observed phenological patterns suggests that both the duration of seasonal activity and the relative timing of activity periods may impact transmission success and parasite fitness (Figs. 3, 4, 6, 5). However, vector phenology is unlikely the only cause of the differences in B. burgdorferi transmission success among these regions as many other features that are known to impact B. burgdorferi also differ including host community composition, tick host preferences, and landscape and climatic features (James and Oliver Jr 1990; LoGiudice et al. 2003; Brisson and Dykhuizen 2004; Ogden et al. 2005b; Brisson et al. 2008; Khatchikian et al. 2012; Vuong et al. 2014; Adalsteinsson et al. 2016; Vuong et al. 2017; Adalsteinsson et al. 2018). Nevertheless, our results add to the body of literature that suggests tick phenology can impact B. burgdorferi fitness.Our model captures the impact of phenology on B. burgdorferi transmission and fitness in a much simpler modeling framework than previously published studies that successfully address several hypotheses specific to the system (Ogden et al. 2004, 2008; Dunn et al. 2013). In particular, previous work focused on accurately predicting B. burgdorferi incidence given phenological scenarios in several realistic environments that depend upon several dozens of parameters, all of which require empirical validation (Ogden et al. 2004). In contrast, our model has 15 parameters and a straightforward structure. This relative simplicity allows our model to serve as a basis for studying phenological impacts in a broad range of environmental scenarios and disease systems as well as exploring the ramifications of other complicating factors such as the evolutionary dynamics of virulence.As all disease systems exhibit seasonality, phenological drivers may have large impacts on the transmission success, and disease risk from, many parasites. Geographic variation in host or vector phenology may also be an important driver of documented variations in pathogen prevalence and disease risk (Altizer et al. 2006; Martinez 2018). Public health predictions of disease risk may be improved by accounting for phenological variation. Further, the dramatic shifts in host and vector phenology driven by global climate change (Penuelas 2001; Meyer et al. 2014; Post et al. 2001; Johansson et al. 2014) may result in equally dramatic shifts in pathogen prevalence at regional or global scales.
