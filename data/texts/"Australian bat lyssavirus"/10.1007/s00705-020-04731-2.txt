2020 taxonomic update for phylum Negarnaviricota (Riboviria: Orthornavirae), including the large orders Bunyavirales and Mononegavirales

Abstract
In March 2020, following the annual International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) ratification vote on newly proposed taxa, the phylum Negarnaviricota was amended and emended. At the genus rank, 20 new genera were added, two were deleted, one was moved, and three were renamed. At the species rank, 160 species were added, four were deleted, ten were moved and renamed, and 30 species were renamed. This article presents the updated taxonomy of Negarnaviricota as now accepted by the ICTV.

Introduction
Phylum Negarnaviricota was established in 2019 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for negative-sense RNA viruses that can be connected evolutionarily through their encoded RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) core domains. The phylum includes two subphyla, Haploviricotina and Polyploviricotina, for negative-sense RNA viruses that encode large (L) proteins with or without mRNA capping activity, respectively. The two subphyla include four classes (Chunqiuviricetes, Milneviricetes, Monjiviricetes, and Yunchangviricetes) and two classes (Ellioviricetes and Insthoviricetes), respectively [56, 109, 136]. The vast majority of viruses that have been assigned to phylum Negarnaviricota belong to two orders: Mononegavirales (established in 1991 [92] and amended/emended in 1995 [16], 1997 [93], 2000 [94], 2005 [95], 2011 [32], 2016 [2], 2017 [7], March 2018 [8], October 2018 [66], and 2019 [9]) and Bunyavirales (established in 2017 and amended/emended in 2018 [64, 65] and 2019 [1]).Here we present the changes that were proposed to the entire phylum Negarnaviricota via official ICTV taxonomic proposals (TaxoProps) in 2019 and that were accepted by the ICTV in March 2020 [128]. These changes are now part of the official ICTV taxonomy.

Taxonomic changes above the phylum rank
Until recently, Negarnaviricota, included in realm Riboviria (established in 2019 [127]), was the only established phylum in the ICTV framework. In 2020, virus taxonomy was amended to include Negarnaviricota in the new riboviriad kingdom Orthornavirae as one of five sister phyla [55] (TaxoProp 2019.006G.A.v1.Riboviria).
