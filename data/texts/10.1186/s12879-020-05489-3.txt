Comparative analysis of the main haematological indexes and RNA detection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection

Abstract
BackgroundSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the diagnostic criterion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, RNA detection has many limitations, such as being time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and it must be performed in specialized laboratories. Virus antibody detection is a routine method for screening for multiple viruses, but data about SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection are limited.MethodThroat swabs and blood were collected from 67 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection patients at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and Zunyi Fourth People’s Hospital isolated observation departments. Throat swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by real-time PCR. Blood was used subjected to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gold immunochromatography assay (GICA). Blood underwent C-reactive protein detection by immunoturbidimetry, and white blood cells, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively. Clinical symptoms, age and lifestyle habits (smoking and drinking) in all patients were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS version 19. The results were confirmed by T and χ2 tests; correlations with detection results were analysed by kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsOf the 67 patients included in this study, 26 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. GICA IgM sensitivity was 50.9% (13/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgM sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgG sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 95.1% (39/41). The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and ELISA IgG, ELISA IgM, and GICA IgM results were 0.741 (P < 0.01), 0.681 (P < 0.01) and 0.430 (P < 0.01), respectively.ConclusionAmong the candidate blood indicators, serum IgG and IgM detected by ELISA had the best consistency and validity when compared with standard RNA detection; these indicators can be used as potential preliminary screening tools to identify those who should undergo nucleic acid detection in laboratories without RNA detection abilities or as a supplement to RNA detection.

Methods
Design and casesWe enrolled a cohort of patients highly suspected of having COVID-2019 from March 1, 2019, to March 31, 2019, at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University. The patient inclusion criteria were as follows: patients who had close contact with a confirmed COVID-2019 patient and fever as well as computed tomography (CT) features according to the guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 [14, 15]. The exclusion criteria were as follows: confirmed negative or positive patients; and patients with no suspected contact history within 2 weeks. Samples were collected approximately 1 week after close contact with a confirmed COVID-2019 patient or clinical symptoms appeared.To avoid false negative results, throat swab samples for RNA detection were collected at least twice per patient, with a 24-h interval, and a positive result was considered the final RNA test result if a positive result was obtained. Throat swabs were used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and blood samples were used for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection and main haematological index (CRP, WBCC, NP and LP) evaluation. Clinical symptoms, age and the lifestyle habits of all patients were recorded.The present study was approved by the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University Ethics Committee under approval number KLL-2020-008. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their guardians.SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectionThroat swabs were collected and transported at 4 °C in RNA storage solution (Zeesan Biotech, Xiamen, Fujian) for SARS-CoV-2 screening. During sample collection, two swabs were obtained from each patient and placed in a single RNA storage solution container for detection. All samples were detected within 6 h of sample collection. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted and purified with a “Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (CDC)” (Xi’an Tianlong Science and Technology, Xi’an, China; batch number: 20021410 T014) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time PCR using the “Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV RNA Detection Kit” (Daan Gene, Guangzhou, China; batch number: 2020001; limit of detection: 500 copies/mL; test results were compared with 3 different concentrations of positive references and 10 negative references) and “Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV RNA Detection Kit” (Shanghai GeneoDX Biotech, Shanghai, China; batch number: COV2020008; limit of detection: 500 copies/mL; test results were compared with 5 different concentrations of positive references and 10 negative references) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Throat swabs were detected by the “Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV RNA Detection Kit” (Daan Gene, Guangzhou, China). Suspected positive (cycle threshold near the cut-off threshold of the kit) and positive samples were detected by both real-time PCR kits mentioned above. Negative and positive controls were included in every experiment.Primers and probes for the two SARS-CoV-2 RNA test kits in this study were established by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the two kits are listed in the WHO Emergency Use Listing. The human housekeeping, SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and N genes were tested in the same reaction in each sample. If the housekeeping gene was amplified effectively (cut-off value ≤32), the sample and reaction were qualified. When the ORF1ab and N genes in a single sample were amplified effectively (both RNA detection kits used in this study had cut-off values ≤40) at the same time, the sample was considered positive. When only the ORF1ab or N gene in a single sample was amplified effectively, the test was repeated immediately; if the result of the repeated test was consistent with the first test, the sample was considered positive; if not, the sample was considered negative.SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detectionBlood serum/plasma samples were used for SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection with a kit (ZHU HAI LIVZON DIAGNOSTICS INC, Guangdong, China; batch number: 2020020308) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) was used for SARS-CoV-2 IgM detection and was performed with a kit (Hotgen, Beijing, China; batch number: 20200204) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative and positive controls were included in every experiment.CRP, WBC, NP and LP detectionC-reactive protein was detected in blood by immunoturbidimetry (automation equipment: Olympus 5400; Beckman Coulter, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. White blood cell counts, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively (automation equipment: Sysmex XN 2000; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Data were analysed using SPSS version 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The results were confirmed by T and χ2 tests; correlations with the detection results were analysed by Kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Discussion
In this study, based on SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results, there were significant differences in the IgM and IgG antibody detection results between SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients by ELISA (P < 0.01) and GICA (P < 0.01) (see Table 2). SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody detection methods had high specificity; and ELISA IgG had the highest specificity (95.1%, 39/41) and the highest sensitivity (90.2%, 37/41). The positive predictive values (90.9%, 20/22) and negative predictive values (86.7%, 39/45) of the ELISA IgM and IgG methods were the highest, while the positive predictive value (83.3%, 20/24) and negative predictive value (86.0%, 37/43) of GICA were lower than those obtained by ELISA. Both the ELISA IgG and IgM methods had high sensitivity (76.9%, 20/26), while the sensitivity of GICA was low (50.9%, 13/26). CRP (P > 0.05), WBCC (P > 0.05), NP (P > 0.05) and LP (P > 0.05) were not specific.SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and close contact; it is easily transmitted in all populations [16]. Generally, fever, fatigue and cough are the main manifestations of COVID-19; a small number of patients have symptoms of nasal obstruction, runny nose, and diarrhoea, while some severe patients have obvious dyspnoea [16,17,18]. In this study, we found that sex, smoking status, and drinking status had no significant association with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but age had a significant association with SARS-CoV-2 infection (shown in Table 1). Although all populations are easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 [16], older people are more likely to be infected. Dyspnoea and muscle pain were not significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but cough was significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (shown in Table 1); cough may be another important early clinical symptom predictive of COVID-19 diagnosis [16]. CRP, the WBCC, the NP and the LP had no significant associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection (all P > 0.05). Fever and CT features were sample screening criteria [16, 18], so fever and CT features were not analysed.Real-time PCR is the most common detection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis [19]. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RNA real-time PCR must be performed in a specific experimental environment (at least a bio-safety level 2 laboratory) that requires specialized experimental equipment and skilled personnel. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA real-time PCR detection method (including RNA extraction) generally requires 3–5 h [18]. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody ELISA generally requires 2–3 h and does not require a specific experimental environment [17]. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody GICA requires approximately 20 min and does not require a specific experimental environment [17].In this study, based on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results, the ORs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in IgM−/IgG-positive and negative patients were calculated. The confirmed OR in the ELISA IgG-positive group compared with that in IgG-negative group was the highest (OR = 65.00, corrected OR = 81.64, P < 0.01), followed by those in ELISA IgM-positive (OR = 30.83, corrected OR = 27.09, P < 0.01) and GICA IgM-positive groups (OR = 9.25, corrected OR = 29.79, P < 0.01). ELISA IgM detection was the most sensitive method in preliminary screening of a high-risk population in this study; CRP (P > 0.05), WBCCs (P > 0.05), NPs (P > 0.05) and LPs (P > 0.05) could not accurately identify high-risk patients. The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and ELISA IgG, ELISA IgM, and GICA IgM detection were 0.741 (P < 0.01), 0.681 (P < 0.01) and 0.430 (P < 0.01), respectively. The consistency between ELISA IgG detection and RNA detection was good, but the consistency between GICA IgM detection and RNA detection was unsatisfactory. The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and the CRP level (P > 0.05), WBCC (P > 0.05), NP (P > 0.05), and LP (P > 0.05) were not statistically significant.Serum samples for antibody detection were easier to collect (lower risk during sample collection) and preserve (the antibody is more stable than RNA) than throat swabs. The ELISA and GICA methods were easier, cheaper and faster than real-time PCR and may be more suitable for primary hospitals. Antibody detection cannot completely replace RNA detection, but it can be auxiliary to RNA detection [19]. ELISA IgG was the best antibody detection method in this study.There were some limitation in this study. The sample size was small, and it was difficult to ascertain the sample collection time point in early screening. In the future, more clinical manifestations and detection indicators should be compared. Additional studies should be performed to validate the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection.

Conclusions
Among the candidate blood indicators, the serum levels of IgG and IgM detected by ELISA had the best consistency and validity when compared with standard RNA detection; antibody detection can be used as a potential preliminary screening method to identify those who should undergo nucleic acid detection in laboratories without RNA detection abilities or as a supplement to RNA detection.
