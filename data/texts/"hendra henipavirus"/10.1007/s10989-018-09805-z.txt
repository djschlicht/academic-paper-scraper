Abstract
Screening of HLA class II epitope-based peptides as potential vaccine candidates is one of the most rational approach for vaccine development against Hendra virus (HeV) infection, for which currently there is no successful vaccine in practice. In this study, screening of epitopes from HeV proteins viz matrix, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, fusion, C protein, V protein, W protein and polymerase, followed by highest binding affinity & molecular dynamic simulation of selected T-cell epitopes with their corresponding HLA class II alleles has been done. The server ProPred facilitates the binding prediction of HLA class II allele specific epitopes from the antigenic protein sequences of HeV. PEPstrMOD server was used for PDB structure modeling of the screened epitopes and MODELLER was used for HLA alleles modeling. We docked the selected T-cell epitopes with their corresponding HLA allele structures using the AutoDock 4.2 tool. Further the selected docked complex structures were optimized by NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics program (NAMD) at 5 ps, with the CHARMM-22 force field parameter incorporated in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD 1.9.2) and complex structure stability was evaluated by calculating RMSD values. Epitopes IRIFVPATN (Nucleocapsid), MRNLLSQSL (Nucleocapsid), VRRAGKYYS (Matrix) and VRLKCLLCG (Fusion) proteins have shown considerable binding with DRB1*0806, DRB1*1304, DRB1*0701 and DRB1*0301 HLA class II allele respectively. Toxicity, antigenicity and population coverage of epitopes IRIFVPATN, MRNLLSQSL, VRRAGKYYS and VRLKCLLCG were analyzed by Toxin Pred, Vexijen and IEDB tool, respectively. The potential T-cell epitopes can be utilized in designing comprehensive epitope-based vaccines and diagnostic kits against Hendra virus after further in-vivo studies.

Introduction
Hendra virus (HeV) initially emerged in an outbreak of acute respiratory disease amongst horses and humans in Australia, 1994 (Murray et al. 1995). Patients of these cases were found to have infected with close contact to diseased horses. Initial cases of Hendra infection clinically diagnosed as severe respiratory infection (Selvey et al. 1995; Hanna et al. 2006; O’Sullivan et al. 1997; Playford et al. 2010). There is no specific treatment for human cases of Hendra virus. Flying foxes (pteopid bats) considered as the natural reservoir of HeV. Transmission of viral infection to humans occurred likely due to exposure of mucous membrane or non-intact skin to nasal secretions, urine and blood of infected horses (Mire et al. 2015). HeV was primarily isolated from infected uterine fluid and fetal tissue of bat species Pteropus policephalus and Pteropus alecto respectively (Halpin et al. 2000). Equivac Hev, a subunit vaccine from glycoprotein of HeV is the only approved licensed vaccine from Australian government which is used for prevention of Hev in the horse population.Peptide vaccines are considered an alternative to classical vaccines that are trying to address issues of possible vaccine side effects related to vaccination with a heterogeneous multicomponent preparation. The peptide-based vaccines include chemical approach to synthesize the selected epitopes that are specific and trigger immune responses. Immunoinformatic focuses mainly on prediction of potential epitopes which brings down the laboratory analysis cost & time of potential vaccine candidate. Using immunoinformatic tools, immunologist can screen and analyze short sequences from the full-length foreign proteins which can act as an immunogenic epitopes & facilitating to be a vaccine candidate (Li et al. 2014; Kamthania and Sharma 2016). Important implication of this study is to screen promiscuous T-cell epitopes from HeV proteins viz matrix, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, fusion, C protein, V protein, W protein, and polymerase. These predicted promiscuous T-cell epitopes may be the promising targets for epitope-based vaccine design for HeV.

Materials and Methods
Retrieval of Amino Acid SequenceThe amino acid sequences of matrix, glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, fusion, C protein, V protein, W protein and polymerase, were retrieved from NCBI protein sequence database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein). The total of 22 nucleocapsid, 20 matrix, 22 fusion, 22 glycoprotein, 14 W protein, 17 V protein, 15 C protein and 15 polymerase protein sequences from different HeV strains, available at NCBI database were retrieved & downloaded in FASTA format.Antigenicity PredictionVaxiJen server (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) (Doytchinova and Flower 2007) was used with default parameters to predict the antigenicity of HeV candidate proteins. The threshold value of vaxiJen was set to 0.4 (default for viruses). The viral proteins having Vaxijen score above 0.4 values were considered to be antigenic in nature. Antigenic proteins were chosen for further study.Promiscuous T-Cell Epitope PredictionThe prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitope binder to HLA class-II alleles was performed by ProPred (Singh and Raghava 2001). ProPred is an on-line web tool; it utilizes matrix-based prediction of HLA (Class II alleles) binding sites in an antigenic protein sequence.3D Structure Prediction of Promiscuous T-cell EpitopesThe PEPstrMOD (Singh et al. 2015) method performed to find out the tertiary structure of selected small epitope with sequence length of nine residues. The PEPstrMOD tool prediction strategy utilizes the secondary structure data anticipated by PSIPRED (Kaur and Raghava 2004) and β-turns data anticipated by BetaTurns (Jones et al. 1999).Modeling of HLA Class II AllelesThe sequences of alleles viz DRB1*1304, DRB1*0804, DRB1*0405, DRB1*0806, DRB1*0402, DRB1*0701, DRB1*1301, DRB1*1104, DRB1*1102. DRB1*0410, DRB1*1128, DRB1*1101, DRB1*0301, & DRB1*0817 were downloaded from IMGT/HLA database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/allele.html) (Robinson et al. 2012). BLASTP program (Altschul et al. 1990) was used to find the templates for these allele sequences and respective PDB IDs (Table 1) retrieved from Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). MODELLER 9.17 (Šali et al. 1995) was used for homology modeling of HLA alleles. Five models were generated by modeller software and the best model chosen based on their lowest predicted discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score. The modeled alleles overall quality was determined using Ramachandran plot analysis utilizing PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993), which detect the geometrical orientation of each amino acid residues with respect to stereochemical parameters.

Molecular DockingAutoDock 4.2 (Morris et al. 1998) was utilized to form the docking complex of predicted T-cell epitopes and HLA alleles. In case of rigid protein & flexible ligand during autodock, the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA) was used. The best conformation of docked complex was chosen on the basis of minimum binding energy and best fitting of epitope-HLA allele complex with highest number of H-bonds formation. Python Molecular Viewer (Sanner et al. 1999) used to visualize the docked complex of HLA allele with predicted T cell epitope.Docked Complex Stability Validation by MD SimulationNAMD used for MD simulation of selected docked complex (Phillips et al. 2005). VMD analyses & view the results of MD simulation & also interface with NAMD (Humphrey et al. 1996). Protein structure file (psf) was made using the topology files and initial pdb files of the HLA II allele- epitope docked complex utilizing psfgen package of VMD. NAMD created the trajectory DCD file. The result of simulation was analyzed by calculation the Root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the docked complex. The rmsd.dat file contains the value of RMSD which was further analyzed by Microsoft office excel.Toxicity Prediction of the Selected T-Cell EpitopesToxinPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/) (Gupta et al. 2013) was utilized to calculate toxicity of predicted T- cell epitopes. ToxinPred is an in-silico method to predict toxic/non-toxic peptides. ToxinPred was run with default parameters and only non-toxic T-cell epitopes were selected for further study.HLA-Distribution AnalysisMHCPred (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/mhcpred/MHCPred/) was utilized to select the high affinity HLA class II binder for selected epitopes with their IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) value. The alleles having cut-off value of IC50 between 0.01 and 500 nM were selected.Population Coverage AnalysisIEDB (Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource) population coverage tool (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/population/iedb_input) (Bui et al. 2006) was used to study the worldwide geographical population coverage by the selected epitopes and HLA Class II alleles pair as resulted from MHCPred (Table 2). Default parameters were set while running the tool. IEDB conservancy tool consist data set frequencies of 3245 alleles for 115 countries, 21 ethnicities and 16 geographical areas. The prediction was taken utilizing the most resent information to set from Allele Frequency Net Database (Gonzalez-Galarza et al. 2010) at IEDB.

Conservancy Analysis of Selected EpitopesTo find out the degree of conservation, all the selected epitopes were aligned against all respective source protein sequences retrieved from NCBI database using EBI-clustal Omega program (Sievers et al. 2011). The Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was visualized using Jalview (Waterhouse et al. 2009). Conservancy analysis was again performed for the selected T-cell epitopes by conservancy tool of IEDB (Table 3) (Bui et al. 2007).

Population Coverage Estimation of Predicted T-Cell EpitopesMHCPred (Guan et al. 2003) was employed to predict the potential HLA allele binders for selected T cell epitopes IRIFVPATN, MRNLLSQSL, VRRAGKYYS and VRLKCLLCG, along with their interacting affinity with IC50 value to be < = 500 nM (Table 2). IEDB tool predicted the four epitopes IRIFVPATN, MRNLLSQSL, VRRAGKYYS and VRLKCLLCG have population coverage of 40.24%, 56.78%, 36.82% and 57.08% respectively for total world population (Table 8). Highest coverage of 59.74%, 53.24% and 66.78% for epitope IRIFVPATN, VRRAGKYYS and VRLKCLLCG respectively were found for population of the Northeast Asia. Epitope MRNLLSQSL has highest coverage of 70.28% in the population of South Asia. The results of high population coverage suggested that the putative T-cell epitopes cover vast majority of geographic population.

Conclusion
This study identified the potential nanomer T-cell epitopes as a vaccine candidate for Hendra virus. T-cell epitopes IRIFVPATN (nucleocapsid), MRNLLSQSL (nucleocapsid), VRRAGKYYS (matrix) and VRLKCLLCG (fusion) were found to have considerable binding with DRB1*0806, DRB1*1304, DRB1*0701, DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0806 HLA class II alleles respectively. The chosen epitopes have shown 100% conservancy throughout all the respective protein sequences from different strains of HeV. These epitopes have shown to have high binding affinity with HLA class II alleles, stable complex formation tendency with HLA class II allele as confirmed by MD simulation results and significant worldwide population coverage. All these results make these epitopes to be a potential candidate for epitope-based vaccine development against HeV infection. Hence reported epitopes may undergo further in-vivo trials to develop vaccine against HeV infection.
