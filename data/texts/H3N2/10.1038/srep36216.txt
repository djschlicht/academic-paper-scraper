Glycosylation changes in the globular head of H3N2 influenza hemagglutinin modulate
receptor binding without affecting virus virulence
http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep36216

Abstract
Since the emergence of human H3N2 influenza A viruses in the pandemic of 1968, these
viruses have become established as strains of moderate severity. A decline in
virulence has been accompanied by glycan accumulation on the hemagglutinin globular
head, and hemagglutinin receptor binding has changed from recognition of a broad
spectrum of glycan receptors to a narrower spectrum. The relationship between
increased glycosylation, binding changes, and reduction in H3N2 virulence is not
clear. We evaluated the effect of hemagglutinin glycosylation on receptor binding
and virulence of engineered H3N2 viruses. We demonstrate that low-binding virus is
as virulent as higher binding counterparts, suggesting that H3N2 infection does not
require either recognition of a wide variety of, or high avidity binding to,
receptors. Among the few glycans recognized with low-binding virus, there were two
structures that were bound by the vast majority of H3N2 viruses isolated between
1968 and 2012. We suggest that these two structures support physiologically relevant
binding of H3N2 hemagglutinin and that this physiologically relevant binding has not
changed since the 1968 pandemic. Therefore binding changes did not contribute to
reduced severity of seasonal H3N2 viruses. This work will help direct the search for
factors enhancing influenza virulence.

Introduction
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) of the H3N2 subtype entered the human population in 1968 when
a reassortant virus (typified by A/Hong Kong/1/68 [HK68]), containing avian-derived
hemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) gene segments and along with 6
segments from the previously circulating H2N2 viruses1, caused a global
pandemic associated with more than one million deaths worldwide2. Since
then, the morbidity and mortality associated with H3N2 virus infection have gradually
diminished3,4. Sequence changes in the HA are believed to be among
the key contributing factors.Over that time, the HA molecule of H3N2 IAV has evolved significantly including
incremental increases in the number of N-linked glycosylation sites on the
globular head5. These sites support attachment of sugar molecules to the
side chain amide nitrogen of Asn in the context of the conserved N-glycosylation
sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr where X may represent any amino acid except Pro. The HA stem region
of human H3N2 viruses has had five N-linked glycosylation sites from the time the
virus entered into the human population to present day6,7 (Fig. 1). In contrast, the globular head of HK68 HA had only twoN-linked glycosylation sites at residues 81 and 165 (numbering is based on
the mature HA molecule6,7). Human H3N2 viruses have subsequently
progressively gained up to seven additional glycosylation sites on the HA globular head
(Fig. 1). While some human isolates have also lost some
globular head glycans over this time5, the general trend toward
increasing glycosylation is clear. There has been no O-linked glycosylation (e.g.
attachment of a sugar molecule to the hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr on the polypeptide
chain) reported for IAV8. The stepwise increase in the number ofN-linked glycosylation sites on the H3 globular head has been shown to reduce
virulence of H3N2 strains9,10,11. We have previously demonstrated this
in mice by using engineered viruses containing an extra two or four glycosylation sites
on the H3N2 IAV HA. Consistent with observations in humans, a progressive reduction of
morbidity, mortality, and viral lung titers in mice was observed as HA glycosylation
increased. Virus neutralization by lung-resident surfactant protein D (SP-D)11, the respiratory tract collectin, and attenuation of H3N2 IAV infection
through ER stress pathways12, has at least in part contributed to the
observed effects. However, it is likely that this increasing glycosylation can diminish
virulence by other mechanisms as well.Figure 1Evolution of H3 N-linked glycosylation from
1968–2013.N-linked glycosylation sites present on the HA trimer of pandemic H3N2
A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK68) (crystal structure PDB 4FNK7) are
shown in red. Glycosylation sites added to H3 during 1968–2013
are colored in blue. Numbers indicate the start of an N-linked
glycosylation sequon (Asn) (numbering based on the mature HA molecule after
cleavage of the 16-amino acid signal but ignoring the HA1-HA2 cleavage site;
residue 483 is HA2 154 in PDB 4FNK). A green oval shows the location of the
receptor binding site (RBS).Full size imageInfluenza HA initiates infection by binding to cell-surface glycan receptors with
terminal N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid [SA]) linked to galactose
via α2,3- or α2,6- linkages, which are abundant on either the
avian gastrointestinal or human upper respiratory tracts (RT), respectively. Recent
glycan microarray analysis of the human H3N2 IAVs binding indicated a change in HA
receptor binding affinity preferences from recognition of a broad range of SA-containing
receptors by earlier viruses, to recognition of mainly long linear glycan structures by
more contemporary isolates13,14. Consistent with this, recent H3N2 IAVs
have a reduced capacity to agglutinate a range of red blood cell types15,16,17,18 and to grow in cell cultures or embryonated chicken
eggs19,20. Data from several studies suggested a link between
declining morbidity and mortality associated with H3N2 infection in humans and reduced
binding to SA-containing receptors18,21,22.Receptor binding properties of HA are determined not only by amino acid residues forming
the receptor binding site (RBS), but also by glycan interactions with HA residues near
the binding pocket23,24, with the precise structure and composition of
the glycans being important factors25. As indicated by two studies using
hemadsorption10 and sialyl glycoconjugate binding22
assays, the progressive addition of glycans to specific sites (mimicking those of
natural human isolates) decreased H3N2 IAV binding to its receptors, although the
precise SA receptors affected by additional glycosylation were not studied. In one
study, the glycosylation-related decrease in HA binding was shown to reduce the lysis of
infected cells by natural killer cells, potentially providing replicative advantages
(e.g. enhanced virulence) for such H3N2 viruses22. The other study linked
glycosylation-related reduction in HA receptor binding with lower replication of H3N2
virus in mice26. However, in contrast to either conclusion, as well as to
the suggestion of a link between reduced binding to SA-containing receptors and the
declining morbidity or mortality associated with H3N2 infection in humans18,21,22, binding data from a collection of human H3N2 IAVs that
circulated from 1968 through 2012 did not indicate a correlation between the strength of
receptor binding and virulence and ability to transmit in human population13.Here, we examine the receptor binding, growth in epithelial cell cultures, and virulence
in mice of engineered H3N2 IAVs11 to understand the contribution of HA
glycosylation to receptor binding of contemporary strains along with consequences for
virulence. We show that modulation in receptor binding efficiency has no effect on
virulence, supporting observations from others on the lack of connection between H3N2
IAV binding and virulence in humans13,14. We propose that this
disconnection is in part due to universal recognition of two specific sialylated
structures.

Results
Glycosylation modulates binding of rgHK68 viruses to sialylated
glycansThe binding of H3N2 variants with different levels of glycosylation was analyzed
using the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) v5.1 glycan array. Three
viruses, constructed by reverse genetics (rg), were used, containing unmodified
HA from wild-type HK68 (rgHK68), or HK68 HA with two (residues 63 and 126:
rgHK68 + 2) or four (residues 63, 126, 133, and 246:
rgHK68 + 4) additional glycosylation sites11. In total, the three rgHK68 viruses bound to 61 sialylated
glycans on the array, with 25 being of α2,3-, 34 of
α2,6-, and 2 of both SA linkages (Table 1
and Fig. 2). These glycans included full glycan structures
as well as substructures. Eleven glycans were recognized by all three rgHK68
viruses. Eighteen glycans were recognized by rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 4 only, and twenty-three and nine glycans were
recognized only by rgHK68 or rgHK68 + 4, respectively.
The most commonly recognized structural motifs were
Neu5Acα2–3(6)Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-,
and the sialylated LacNAc repeat
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-.Table 1 Binding of rgHK68 viruses in a glycan arraya.Full size tableFigure 2Binding of rgHK68 viruses to sialic acids on a glycan array.(A) Binding of rgHK68, rgHK68 + 2, and

units (RFU; indicated on the vertical axis).Full size imageAs expected, rgHK68 showed higher binding than did its glycosylation variants,
based on both the number of glycans bound and the total level of fluorescent
intensity (Fig. 2A,B). It recognized a total of 52N- and O-linked sialylated glycans on the array (Table 1 and Fig. 2A), consisting of
17 with α2,3-, 33 with α2,6-, and 2 with both SA
linkages. The glycans containing terminal α2,6-linked SA were among
the strongest binders on the array, with the sum of all the binding intensities
for this group being 27,547 ± 3,871 relative
fluorescent units (RFU; Fig. 2B). Structurally, the rgHK68
recognized multiantennary glycans (such as glycans 57, 464, 466, 481, 482, and
606; the glycan numbering corresponds to those of the CFG v5.1 glycan array)
with LacNAc substitutions or LacNAc repeats (short poly LacNAc; glycans 606 and
608) as major components at the highest affinity. In terms of antennary
substructures, the
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Mana1,3-
arm of the N-linked glycan (glycans 319, 346, and 348) appears to be a
stronger requirement for high affinity binding than the equivalent
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Mana1,6-
arm (glycans 308, 345, and 347). The glycans containing terminal
α2,3-linked SA (including those with a LacNAc motif such as glycans
237, 266, 325, 462, 483, and 600) were also bound by rgHK68, however, at lower
overall affinity (8,323 ± 1,046 RFU; Fig. 2B) than those with α2,6-linkage. Of the
glycans with a mixture of Neu5Acα2,6- and
Neu5Acα2,3-substitution (glycans 318 and 326) only glycan 326 with a
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Mana1,3-arm
bound strongly, consistent with the notion that this arm is a robust facilitator
of receptor binding. Consistent with findings from others13,14,
key structural motifs required for efficient rgHK68 binding were
Neu5Acα2,6-LacNAc and poly LacNAc. Multiple antennae generally
increased binding signal. The Neu5Acα2,3-capped glycans also were
seen to bind strongly albeit less intensely than their
Neu5Acα2,6-capped counterparts.Adding glycans to residues 63 and 126 of the HK68 HA
(rgHK68 + 2) markedly reduced virus binding to glycans
on the CFG array. The virus containing the rgHK68 + 2 HA
showed recognition of only four α2,3-linked SA and seven
α2,6-linked SA (Table 1 and Fig. 2A), and had the lowest total fluorescence intensities of the
three viruses (1,049 ± 94 RFU for
α2,3- and 2,825 ± 301 RFU for
α2,6-linked SAs; Fig. 2B). Among the glycans
that bound both rgHK68 and rgHK68 + 2, signal was
diminished ~20 to 80% in the rgHK68 + 2
virus analysis. The strongest intensity was produced by biantennaryN-linked glycans 57, 325, 481, and 483. A striking quality of the
rgHK68 + 2 virus binding pattern was a complete lack of
significant interaction with compounds with a higher number of antennae, the
opposite of the rgHK68 virus.Unexpectedly, adding two further glycans to positions 133 and 246 of
rgHK68 + 2 HA, to create
rgHK68 + 4, restored much of the binding. The
rgHK68 + 4 bound to 21 α2,6-, 15
α2,3-and two dual-linked SAs with total binding intensities of
25,956 ± 3,009 RFU,
6,610 ± 649 RFU, and
1,724 ± 160 RFU, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2A,B).
Interestingly, adding glycans to residues 133 and 246 on the H3 globular head
not only restored rgHK68 + 4 binding to some of SAs
bound by rgHK68, but also allowed greater signal intensity for some glycans than
detected for rgHK68 (Table 1). Among the most striking
changes were increases in signal from bi- and triantennary glycans containing
Neu5Acα2,3-substitutions and those with
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manβ1,6
arm of the sialyl N-glycans. As seen for the rgHK68 virus, the
rgHK68 + 4 showed strong binding signals to glycans
containing both LacNAc and poly LacNAc units. Unlike rgHK68, there was no
preference for
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manb1,3-
over
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–2Manb1,6-
(compare binding to glycans 319, 346 and 348 with that to glycans 308, 345 and
347). A significant difference in binding between rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 4 was observed for glycans possessing dual SA
linkages (e.g. glycans 318 and 326). In the case of rgHK68 the preference is for
glycan 326 where the Neu5Acα2,6 is present on the Mana1,3 arm and
the Neu5Acα2,3 is present on the Man1,6 arm. In the case of rgHK+4,
the preference is for glycan 318 where the Neu5Acα2–6 is
present on the Mana1,6 arm and Neu5Acα2,3 is present on the Man1,3
arm. More striking, binding of rgHK68 + 4 to
Neu5Acα2,6 capped chitobiose and chitotriose (glycans 366 and 367)
was nearly five times higher than that of rgHK68.Similarly to rgHK68, both glycosylation variants
(rgHK68 + 2 and rgHK68 + 4)
preferentially bound to Neu5Acα2,6-linked glycans, but also retained
substantial recognition of Neu5Acα2,3-linked glycans, with the
proportion of α2,3- and α2,6-linked SAs being similar
for all viruses (31% to 39% for α2–3-linkage, and of 55%
to 63% for α2,6-linkage; Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Titrating the concentration of virus confirmed the
binding patterns observed with rgHK68 viruses at standard experimental
conditions (Fig. 2C).These results demonstrate that rgHK68 viruses were able to recognize a wide range
of sialylated glycans with both α2,6- and α2,3-linkages
on the CFG v5.1 array (Table 1). Next, we evaluated
rgHK68 viruses’ bindings to the subset of glycans on the CFG array
that are biologically relevant for influenza pathogenesis in the human RT27. Importantly, most of the glycans on the array that are
significantly bound by rgHK68 viruses were structurally related to those found
in human RT. In general, the trends seen with the complete CFG v5.1 array were
also seen when the analysis was limited to those glycans on the array that are
present in the human RT (Table 1). Binding to the SAs
within this subset was comparable for the rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 4 viruses, while binding of
rgHK68 + 2 was less than 50% or 20% (based on the number
of glycans bound and the level of total binding intensity, respectively) of that
determined for rgHK68 or rgHK68 + 4. Virus
rgHK68 + 4 uniquely recognized 3 N-linked glycan
structures of the human RT (301, 460, and 461) that were not recognized by
either rgHK68 or rgHK68 + 2. Similar to rgHK68, both
glycosylation variants (rgHK68 + 2 and
rgHK68 + 4) preferentially bound to
α2,6-linked SAs, but also retained substantial recognition of
α2,3-linked SA.These results demonstrate that increasing N-linked glycosylation of HK68
HA can significantly alter (i.e. reduce or increase) virus binding to
SA-containing receptors, including receptors that are present in the human
RT.Red blood cell type modulates elution pattern of rgHK68 virusesTo evaluate the functional significance of the SA binding data inferred from the
glycan array, we measured elution of the viruses from red blood cells (RBC)
possessing different proportions of α2,3- and
α2,6-linked SAs. RBC from chicken and human (which are abundant in
α2,3-linked SAs), and guinea pig and turkey (which are abundant in
α2,6-linked SAs) were used in these tests17,28,29.Virus elution from chicken, human, and guinea pig RBC at
37 °C (Fig. 3) correlated well
with the observed binding to SA on the CFG array. Those viruses with the highest
binding profiles on the CFG array, rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 4, eluted from these RBC more slowly than did
the “low binding” rgHK68 + 2.
The latter completely dissociated from chicken RBC, and partially (to 1
hemagglutination units [HAU]) dissociated from human and guinea pig RBC, after
8 hours of incubation. In contrast, the rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 4 viruses stayed attached at 8 to 16 HAU at
this time point. Indeed, rgHK68 never completely eluted from these RBC over the
20-hour course of the experiment. None of the viruses eluted from these RBC at
4 °C after 20 hours (data not shown), a
temperature at which the level of the IAV neuraminidase (NA) activity is
minimal30. Our data therefore suggest that the avidity of
rgHK68 + 2 virus to SA receptors present on chicken,
human and guinea RBC (as determined at 37 °C) is much
lower than that of rgHK68 or rgHK68 + 4. In contrast to
chicken, human, and guinea pig RBC, none of the rgHK68 viruses eluted from
turkey RBC even after 20 hours of incubation at elevated temperature
of 37 °C. Importantly, even though
rgHK68 + 2 bound to a limited number of sialylated
structures with relatively low affinity, it remained attached to the TRBC for
the full 20-hour experiment.Figure 3Elution of rgHK68 viruses from red blood cells.In HA assays, the rgHK68, rgHK68 + 2, and
rgHK68 + 4 were diluted to provide 16 HAU with 0.5%
chicken, or human, or turkey, or 0.75% guinea pig RBC after 1 hour at
4 °C. Then the plates were shifted to
37 °C, and elution of viruses from RBC was recorded
after 4, 8, and 20 hours of incubation.Full size imageAlthough each of the rgHK68 viruses contained NAs with identical sequences, it
remained possible that different amounts of NA could incorporate into each
virion (which might affect the catalytic activity of the virus and therefore the
elution rate), or that the changes in HA might indirectly alter NA activity. We
therefore compared virus NA activities, relative to both NA and NP content, in a
standard fluorometric assay at the same pH (7.2) as was used in the elution
tests (Fig. 4). NA activity was similar for rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 2. The rgHK68 + 4
showed slightly higher catalytic activity than did rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 2; however, this effect would increase elution
rates while rgHK68 + 4 eluted from chicken, human, and
guinea pig RBC much more slowly than did rgHK68 + 2 and,
similar to rgHK68 and rgHK68 + 2, did not elute from
turkey RBC. Therefore this difference would not be responsible for the slow
elution of rgHK68 + 4.Figure 4Catalytic activities of rgHK68 viruses.The activity of each viral NA was measured by a standard fluorometric assay
and proportioned to the amount of NA or NP in the sample. The NA activities
(expressed as NA/NA and NA/NP ratios) of rgHK68 + 2
and rgHK68 + 4 mutants are normalized to those of
rgHK68. Error bars indicate the standard deviations (SD) of the mean of the
results from three independent experiments. An asterisk indicates a
significant difference (p < 0.05) by unpaired Student’s
t-test compared with rgHK68 and rgHK68 + 2.Full size imageOur data from elution tests with chicken, human, and guinea pig RBC therefore
strongly support results from glycan array assays showing a selective impact of
HA glycosylation on rgHK68 viruses’ binding to SA-containing
receptors. The inability of rgHK68 viruses to elute from turkey RBC suggested
that the turkey erythrocytes have a distinct pattern of sialylated receptors
compared to the other tested RBC, and indicated a dominant role of cell surface
glycan composition in the biological outcome of H3N2 virus binding. The lack of
rgHK68 + 2 virus elution from turkey RBC suggests that a
low level of binding to limited set of glycans is still sufficient for
biologically functional binding when the target cell surface possesses a
particular set of sialyl glycans.Broad-range high-affinity receptor binding is not a critical determinant
of the replication of HK68 viruses in tissue culture and associated
cytopathologyWe compared growth of rgHK68, rgHK68 + 2, or
rgHK68 + 4 viruses in epithelial cell cultures of
various origins such as NHBE (primary human bronchial), Calu-3 (human
bronchial), A549 (human alveolar), MDCK (canine kidney), and Vero (African Green
Monkey kidney) at low (0.01) or high (1.0) multiplicities of infection (MOI) at
various times post-infection. We also compared virus replication in Calu-3 cells
grown in liquid-covered culture (LCC), which does not produce mucin, or in
air-interface culture (AIC), which does produce mucin and most closely mimics
the conditions of RT, at temperatures reflective of the proximal
(32 °C) and distal (37 °C)
airways. The Calu-3 cell line has features of differentiated, functional human
airway epithelial cells31 (including forming polarized layers
with apical and basolateral surfaces and secreting mucin), expresses SA
receptors preferred by human H3N2 viruses32, and is a
well-established human respiratory epithelial cell model for IAV infection32,33.There were no consistent significant differences associated with receptor binding
or glycosylation observed in the growth kinetics between the three viruses in
any of the cell types under any conditions (Fig. 5). The
ability to bind a wide range of sialylated glycans with high affinity did not
enhance the replication of rgHK68 and rgHK68 + 4
compared to rgHK68 + 2 in cell culture, and low binding
did not reduce it for rgHK68 + 2.Figure 5Growth kinetics of rgHK68 viruses in epithelial cell lines.Cell monolayers were infected with rgHK68, or

MOI 0.01 (A and C) or 1.0 (B) at
37 °C (A, B and C) or at
32 °C (C). Viruses’ growth in
Calu-3 cells (C) was examined in the absence or presence of mucin (as
indicated). Virus titers were determined for apical culture supernatant
fluids at the times indicated on the x-axis. Error bars indicate the SD of
the mean of the results from three independent experiments (MDCK, A549, and
Vero cell lines) or from three cultures (NHBE and Calu-3 cell lines).Full size imageTo evaluate the cytopathic effect (CPE) associated with viruses’
growth, we examined the zona occludens protein-1 (ZO-1; a major component of
tight junction) in Calu-3 LLC monolayers infected with rgHK68 viruses by
immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6). In uninfected
cells, the ZO-1 protein was localized at the cell-cell boundary in a typical
chicken wire-like pattern throughout the monolayer, indicating the presence of
intact tight junctions (Fig. 6B). In contrast, extensive
CPE was observed in Calu-3 cells infected with each of the viruses, as evidenced
by disruption of tight junctions, internalization of ZO-1 protein, and
irregularity of the cell margins. As with growth kinetics (Fig.
6A), the three rgHK68 viruses induced comparable level of CPE (Fig. 6B).Figure 6Cell pathology induced by rgHK68 viruses.Monolayers of Calu-3 cells grown in liquid-covered conditions were infected

of the virulence of HK68 viruses in miceThe virulence of these viruses in mice has previously been studied, but only at
high infectious dose of 106 plaque forming unit (PFU) per
mouse11,12. At this high virus dose, there was no
correlation between H3N2 virulence and receptor binding.To more fully test biological effects associated with receptor binding, we
infected BALB/c mice intranasally with lower non-lethal doses ranging from
102.4 to 105.0 PFU that may more accurately
reflect natural infection doses34. Virulence at these lower doses
was determined by measuring weight loss and viral lung titers.Adding either two or four glycosylation sites to the HK68 HA incrementally
reduced rgHK68 virus replication and virulence in mice (Fig.
7). As with elution from turkey RBC (Fig. 3)
and replication in cultured cells (Fig. 5), the number of
sialylated glycans bound and the affinity of binding did not correlate with H3N2
virulence in mice (Fig. 7). Thus, when mice were
challenged with 105.0 PFU the mean mouse lung titers of
rgHK68 + 4 were up to 1,000-fold lower than titers of
rgHK68 (which bound similar levels of SA), while
rgHK68 + 2 (which bound much lower levels of SA than
either rgHK68 or rgHK68 + 4) produced up to 500-fold
higher titers than did rgHK68 + 4
(p < 0.05; Fig. 7A).
Similarly, the weight loss (Fig. 7B) of mice infected with
rgHK68 was significantly higher than that of mice infected with
rgHK68 + 4 (p < 0.05),
and mice infected with rgHK68 + 2 lost a similar amount
of weight as rgHK68 + 4-infected mice. Challenging with
a lower virus dose (102.4 PFU) showed similar effects on mice
relative to the higher dose (data not shown).Figure 7Pathogenicity of rgHK68 viruses in mice.(A) Virus lung titers and (B) weight loss in BALB/c mice

mice indicate that modulations of rgHK68 virus receptor binding with additionalN-linked glycosylation do not translate to such biological
consequences as virus virulence.

Discussion
A decline in the severity of illness and of excess mortality attributed to H3N2
viruses since 1968 has paralleled the progressive addition of N-linked
glycans to the globular head of HA. We have previously shown that increasing HA
glycosylation can reduce H3N2 virulence in mice through virus neutralization by
respiratory tract collectin SP-D11 and through abrogation of the
inflammation associated with activation of ER stress pathways12.
Glycans on HA can also reduce receptor binding9,10,22,23,26,35,
which in turn may affect viral virulence. We therefore tested the connection between
glycosylation, receptor binding, and virulence.Increasing HA glycosylation had complex effects on ligand binding by rgHK68 viruses.
Adding two glycosylation sites to the HK68 HA (rgHK68 + 2)
resulted in reduced binding avidity and the number of recognized sialylated
structures, while adding four sites (rgHK68 + 4) enhanced
binding compared to rgHK68 + 2. The effect on receptor
binding could be due to structural interference between the RBS and carbohydrates.
The tri- and tetra-antennary glycans at sites 63 and 126 of
rgHK68 + 2 HA36 could obstruct the RBS due to
their close proximity (within ~10 Å; Fig. 1) and considerable hydrodynamic radii. In the case of
rgHK68 + 4, additional glycans at sites 133 and 246,
essentially inside the RBS, being primarily substituted with high mannose
glycans36 could favorably interact sterically in the region which
would facilitate restoration of receptor function. Either possibility suggests that
the specific glycan position and composition, and not merely the number of
glycosylated sites, can influence the recognition of sialylated receptors by H3N2
viruses.While some studies have found a correlation between receptor binding and IAV
virulence18,21,22,26, there is growing evidence that the HA
binding to SA-containing receptors does not always correlate with infection in
itself37,38,39,40,41,42. Consistent with the latter and our
previous observation that variations in SA binding by H3N2 IAVs isolated from 1968
to 2012 does not correlate with disease severity or spread13,
modulation in receptor binding of rgHK68 viruses had no effect on such viral
characteristics as elution from turkey RBC, growth in epithelial cell cultures,
cytopathology, or virulence in mice. One possible explanation for this may be a role
for post-attachment factors37,38,39,40,41,42. Another
possibility is that H3N2 binding and entry is mainly dependent on only a limited
subset of sialylated glycans, and that binding to these biologically critical
ligands has remained relatively constant over time.This set of critical ligands would be included in the eleven human RT SA recognized
by rgHK68 + 2 (Group I of Table 1),
a biologically competent virus with weak narrow-specificity binding. Two
α2,6-linked SA structures of Group I
(Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-Sp0
and
Neu5Acα2–6Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-Sp0;
glycans 271 and 332, respectively) were recognized by all nineteen H3N2 IAV
recombinant HAs (the components of the seasonal influenza vaccines between 1968 and
2012)14 as well as by rgHK68 and
rgHK68 + 4 (Table 1 and Fig. 8). Moreover, 43 of 45 H3N2 IAVs isolated between 1968 and
2012 recognized these structures13 (Fig. 8).
Interestingly, most viruses isolated from 1995 till 2012 bound only compounds 271
and 332. The only two isolates that did not recognize these structures (A/BCM/1/1972
and A/OK/5098/1996) also failed to recognize any of the other human RT-associated
structures on the CFG array. Although these viruses were both natural isolates from
human infection, their virulence and modes of infection have not been further
investigated.Figure 8Binding of H3N2 influenza A viruses to receptors of human RT.The heat map of relative binding percent of viruses used in our previous13 and current studies to human RT-associated glycans27 on version 5.1 of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics

- Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Sp14.Full size imageCompounds 271 and 332 contain relatively short poly LacNAc and represent poly LacNAc
antennae, with the former containing 3.0 repeats and the latter containing 2.5. The
poly LacNAc containing structures are widely distributed through all parts of human
RT27 (Table 1), consistent with a role in
H3 IAV pathogenesis. We suggest that glycans 271 and 332 support physiologically
relevant binding of H3N2 HA to the human respiratory tract. Binding to other glycans
may provide redundancy, without being strictly required for infectivity. Because
H3N2 IAVs isolated from 1968 to 2012 bind these relevant structures, we suggest that
physiologically relevant receptor binding by H3N2 HA has not changed over the 40
years during which these IAV have circulated in humans. This may help explain the
poor correlation between viruses’ receptor binding and pathogenicity,
also it implies that receptor binding was not a factor that has contributed to the
reduced pathogenicity of recent human seasonal H3N2 viruses.In addition, the same structures (either as sialosides or as the linear terminal
fragments) were the most efficiently recognized structures by all tested recombinant
HAs from human IAVs of H1 and H2 subtypes43. Thus, our hypothesis of
“unmodified physiologically relevant receptor binding” may
explain the disconnection between the receptor binding and virulence of IAV of other
subtypes as well.

Methods
CellsEpithelial cell lines Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), human alveolar lung
adenocarcinoma (A549), African Green Monkey kidney (Vero), and human bronchial
lung adenocarcinoma (Calu-3) were purchased from American Tissue Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) were
purchased from Lonza (Allendale, NJ). MDCK, A549, Vero, and Calu-3 cells were
grown in 1× minimum essential medium (MEM) that contained
2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1.5 g/liter sodium
bicarbonate, and 5–10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NHBE cells were
grown in serum-free and hormone-supplemented bronchial epithelial growth medium
according to the manufacturer’s procedure. Calu-3 and NHBE cells
were seeded onto 24- and 6.5-mm-diameter semipermeable membrane inserts
(Corning, NY), respectively, with a final cell density of
3–5 × 105
cells per insert. Cells were grown for 1 week in liquid-covered culture (LCC;
Calu-3) or 4–6 weeks in air-interface culture (AIC; Calu-3 and NHBE)
with the addition of fresh culture medium every 2 to 3 days, as previously
described31,32,44.VirusesConstruction of rg H3N2 IAV containing six internal gene segments of H1N1
A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and the HA and NA of HK68, and modification of the HA to
generate two mutant variants with additional N-linked glycosylation sites
at positions 63 and 126 (rgHK68 + 2), or at positions
63, 126, 133, and 246 (rgHK68 + 4), has been previously
described11. Numbering of glycosylation sites is based on the
sequence of the mature HK68 HA molecule without the 16 a.a. signal sequence6,7. These sites were selected as they reflect changes that
appeared naturally during H3N2 IAV evolution at periods of significant antigenic
drifts in the 1970s (represented by rgHK68 + 2) and 1995
(represented by rgHK68 + 4)45,46. The
rescued viruses were amplified once in eggs and then grown in MDCK cells for
stocks. Stocks were fully sequenced to ensure no inadvertent mutations occurred
during rescue or passage. The infectivity of stock viruses was determined by
plaque assays or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays
as described elsewhere47. A mass spectrometry-based platform
analysis was used to confirm the occupancy of sites by N-linked
glycosylation36. The usage of chimeric viruses allowed us to
exclude the contribution of factors other than additional glycosylation to the
observations.Hemagglutination and elution assaysHemagglutination assays were performed using 0.5% chicken, human, and turkey, and
0.75% guinea pig RBC as described elswhere48. In the elution
tests, each rgHK68 virus was diluted to provide 16 HAU after 1 hour
at 4 °C, then the plate was shifted to
37 °C, and elution of viruses from RBC was recorded
after 4, 8, and 20 hours of incubation.Neuraminidase assaysCell-grown rgHK68 viruses were concentrated and purified through a gradient of
30% to 50% sucrose in PBS, as described previously48. The
neuraminidase (NA) activities of the concentrated purified viruses were analyzed
with a standard fluorometric assay using
2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic
acid (MUNANA; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) as the substrate49, with some modifications. Enzyme kinetic assays were conducted
in CMS buffer (0.25 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM
MgCl2 and 0.15 mM NaCl) pH 7.2 on pre-warmed plates,
and read on a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.,
Sunnyvale, CA) using excitation and emission wavelengths 365 and
460 nm, respectively. The enzyme kinetic data were fit to the
Michaelis-Menten equation by using nonlinear regression to establish the
Michaelis constant and the maximum velocity of substrate conversion. The NA
activities of viruses were then calculated per 1 μg of
the virion HA or NP. The amounts of the HA, NA and NP proteins in the sample
were determined by 7.5% to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide bis-Tris
gel (SDS-PAGE; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and by Western blot analysis with
rabbit antisera containing antibodies against recombinant A/Memphis/1/1971
(H3)-Bel/1942 (N1) for HA, A/Tokyo/3/1967 (H2N2) for NA, and PR8 for NP
detection, and secondary goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugated
antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO). The imaging was accomplished
using Epson Perfection 2400 Photo Scanner (Long Beach, CA), and the densities of
the HA, NA or NP bands were analyzed with Gel Eval (v1.37, FrogDance Software,
UK).Labelling of virus HAThe labelling of viruses with Alexa Fluor-488 (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD)
was performed as described previously13. Briefly, concentrated
purified virus was pelleted out of sucrose and resuspended in a solution
containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.25 mM CaCl2, and
0.8 mM MgCl2 to about
1.0 × 105 HAU per ml.
Then 100 μl of virus suspension was mixed with
10 μl of 1.0 M NaHCO3 (pH 9.0),
and 0.005 μg of Alexa Fluor-488 succinimidyl ester per
HAU was added to mixture. After stirring for 1 hour at room
temperature (RT) in the dark, the sample was dialyzed in borate buffered saline
containing 0.25 mM CaCl2 and 0.8 mM
MgCl2 (pH 7.2) at 4 °C overnight using
Slide-A-Lyzer Mini Dialysis Units 7000 MWCO (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL). The Alexa-labeled virus HA was confirmed by fluorescence of the HA1 band on
a 9% SDS-PAGE gel. Virus binding activity was an additionally evaluated by HA
tests to assure that receptor recognition was not affected by the labelling
procedure.Glycan array assays with Alexa-labelled virusesGlycan binding analysis (in six replicates) was performed by the Protein-Glycan
Interaction Core of the CFG, as described50. Briefly,
50 μl of various dilutions (ranging from
2,550 HA to 25,500 HAU) of Alexa-labelled viruses in binding buffer
pH 7.0 (which inhibits the NA activity) was applied to the printed surface of a
slide (v5.1; containing 610 glycans, www.functionalglycomics.org) for 1 hour at
4 °C. The binding image was read in a Perkin-Elmer
Microarray XL4000 scanner and analyzed using Imagine image analysis software
(v6.0). For comparison, viruses’ binding was assessed at three
concentrations (Fig. 2C) and 6 repetitions for each
concentration. The binding was then proportioned to a standard 10,200 HAU and
averaged. Binding below 100 RFU was considered to be irrelevant.Cell culture infectionIn growth kinetics assays, cells were infected with rgHK68 viruses at MOI 0.01 or
1.0 in MEM supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated at
32 °C or 37 °C for the duration
of the experiment. Prior to infection, the monolayers of Calu-3 (LCC and AIC)
and NHBE (AIC) cells were washed with PBS. In case of NHBE cells, apical
secretions were transiently removed. After being washed, cells were supplied
with fresh basolateral MEM containing BSA. Virus diluted in PBS was added to the
apical surface of cells in a volume of 300 μl for
1.5 hours at 32 °C or
37 °C. Following incubation, monolayers were washed with
PBS to remove nonadherent virus and incubated at AIC at designated temperatures
for the duration of experiment. At indicated times, apical surfaces of Calu-3 or
NHBE cells were washed with 300 μl of MEM-BSA for
30 min at 32 °C or
37 °C.MDCK, A549, and Vero cells in 24-well plates were infected with rgHK68 viruses
for 1 hour at RT. After virus adsorption, cells were washed 3 times
with PBS, pH 7.2, then incubated in infection media containing
1 μg/ml acetylated trypsin.In all cases, tissue culture supernatants were collected at time points ranging
from 4 to 96 hours. The amount of virus in the apical washes from
Calu-3 and NHBE cells or tissue culture supernatants from MDCK, A549, and Vero
cells was determined by TCID50 assays in MDCK cells.Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunofluorescence
assaysTo examine cytopathic effect associated with rgHK68 viruses’ growth,
Calu-3 cells (LLC) were infected with each virus at MOI 0.001 for
36 hours. Following infection, monolayers on membrane inserts were
washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with
Ca2+/Mg2+, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for
15 minutes at RT. After being washed, cells were permeabilized in
0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween-20, then blocked with 2% PBS-diluted normal
goat serum (blocking solution) for 30 min and incubated with primary
antibody directed against ZO-1 protein (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.,
Danvers, MA) at a 1:250 dilution in blocking solution overnight at
4 °C. After being washed, cells were incubated with
secondary Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated antibody (Life Technologies,
Rockville, MD) at a 1:1000 dilution in blocking solution for 1 hour
at RT in the dark. After a final wash with PBS, cells were mounted with ProLong
Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) containing
4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining. Tissue
culture filters housing the epithelial cell monolayers were carefully detached
from their support and mounted on coverslips. Fluorescence was visualized with
an inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 710, Zeiss, Germany). Using
an automated XY stage control within the Zen software, sections were
systematically imaged with a x100 objective lens. One micrometer Z-stacks were
captured and maximum intensity volume projections were used for subsequent
analysis. Images were further processed using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe, Inc., San
Jose, CA).Animal studiesExperiments using 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar
Harbor, ME) were performed in a Biosafety Level 2 facility in the Animal
Resources Center at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude;
Memphis, TN) and Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC; Atlanta,
GA). Animals were given general anesthesia that consisted of 2.5% inhaled
isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL) prior to all
interventions. All studies were approved by the respective institutional animal
care and use committees at St. Jude and CDC. All methods were performed in
accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.To compare the pathogenicity of rgHK68 viruses, mice were infected intranasally
(i.n.) with doses of 102.4 and 105 PFU per mouse
in 50 μl of sterile PBS. Control mice were administered
PBS only. After 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, or 9 days, lungs from 3 to 5 mice
from each group were removed under sterile conditions, washed 3 times with PBS,
homogenized, and suspended in PBS (total volume, 1 ml). The
suspensions for virus titration were centrifuged at
2,000 × g for
10 minutes to clear cellular debris. Virus titers were determined by
TCID50 assays in MDCK cells. Weight changes (calculated for each
mouse as a percentage of its weight on day 0 before virus infection) were
monitored daily for each group (n = 10) for 21 days
after infection.Glycan array data processing for human H3N2 isolatesRelative binding of each virus isolate used in our previous study13 to each human RT-associated glycan27 on the CFG printed array
v5.1 was calculated by normalizing the highest RFU value in the subset to 100
for each virus and expressing binding to other glycans as a percentage of that
value; in this way the RFUs for three concentrations of virus could be averaged.
The heat map of relative binding percent was created using open-source software
Python v3.4 and Matplotlib v1.4.Statistical analysesAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison
test was used to estimate and compare the NA activities, viral titers in the
mouse lungs and cell culture supernatants, and weight loss. A
p-value < 0.05 was considered significant for
these comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
Software (v4.0, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).
