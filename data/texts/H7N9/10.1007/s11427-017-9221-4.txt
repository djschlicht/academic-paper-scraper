Abstract
Since the identification of the novel reassortant avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China in 2013, until Jun 30, 2017, the virus has caused five epidemic waves leading to a total of 1,552 human infections, with a fatality rate of about 40%. In the spring of 2017, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 virus emerged and has caused 25 human infections. The HPAI H7N9 virus has some biological differences from the LPAI one, such as its multiple basic amino acid residues on HA leading to its independence on trypsin for replication. The pathogenicity of the HPAI H7N9 virus to experimental animals or humans is still unclear. A(H7N9) vaccine development for pandemic preparedness is ongoing, including the reassortment (H7N9/PR8) reverse genetic based vaccine, the virus like particle (VLP) vaccine, the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), the non-adjuvant Vero cell culture-derived inactivated whole-virus vaccine, the MDCK culture-derived vaccine, the H7 DNA vaccine and the recombinant replicative H7N9 virus (H7N9-53TM) vaccine. Five neuramidinase resistant sites of A(H7N9) virus isolated from patients have been reported. Some alternative drugs have been studied, such as DAS181 (Fludase), ribavirin, troglitazone and minocycline. Persistent surveillance and enhanced global control are essential to fight against human infections with A(H7N9) virus.
