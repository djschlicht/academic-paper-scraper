Abstract
Viral RNAs can perturb the miRNA regulatory network, competing with host RNAs as part of their infective process. An in silico competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis has been carried on SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that, in humans, the decrease of microRNA activity caused by viral RNAs can lead to a perturbation of vesicle trafficking and the inflammatory response, in particular by enhancing KLF10 activity.Â The results suggest also that, during the study of the mechanics of viral infections, it could be of general interest to investigate the competition of viral RNA with cellular transcripts for shared microRNAs.
