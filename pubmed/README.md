# PubMed

## Summary
The purpose of academic-paper-scraper is to automate data collection from
academic databases. Our use case is to gather sources of information regarding the traits
of emerging infectious pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika, but it 
can be easily adapted for other research goals. It currently uses the 
Springer APIs to search for articles, but functionality for the Elsevier 
APIs is in progress.
