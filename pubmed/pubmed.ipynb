      "    \"abstract\": \"Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) is an increasingly recognized complication of improper vaccine administration. Due to the growing number of mandatory workplace vaccination programs, especially for annual influenza vaccine, it is essential that occupational health providers are aware of this condition to improve prevention and/or treatment of this condition when it arises. Therefore, we describe the clinical presentation and course of treatment of five cases of SIRVA that were seen in an employer-based Occupational Health Services Clinic (OHS) after mandatory influenza vaccine administration.\\nA retrospective chart review was performed for five cases of SIRVA from 2017 to 2019.\\nFive cases met clinical definition of SIRVA as defined by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. All cases were of similar characteristics including gender, age range, and body mass index (BMI). All were treated using multiple modalities including medication, physical therapy, and modified work with eventual resolution of symptoms and full return to work.\\nAwareness of SIRVA is necessary in any occupational setting where vaccines are routinely administered. Avoidance of SIRVA by adhering to proper vaccination technique is crucial, as is awareness of how to recognize and manage the condition in affected employees to limit long-term impairment.\",\n",

In Africa, only 5% of employees working from major establishments have access to occupational health services (OHS). Access to primary health care (PHC) services is addressed in many settings and inclusion of OHS in these facilities might increase efficiency in preventing occupational diseases. A cross-sectional study was conducted in four Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries aiming at assessing the availability of OHS at PHC facilities and the organization of OHS. We conducted a literature review to assess the provision and organization of OHS services. In addition to the review, a total of 23 doctors from Zambia were interviewed using questionnaires in order to determine the availability of OHS and training. Consultations with heads of ministries were done in four SADC countries. Results showed that in the SADC region, OHS are fragmented and lack a comprehensive approach. In addition, out of 23 PHC facilities, only two (13%) provided occupational health and PHC. However, OHS provided at PHC facilities were limited to TB screening and audiometric testing. Our study showed a huge inadequacy of trained occupational health practitioners. This study supports the World Health Organization's advocacy to integrate OHS at the PHC level.\",\n",

Previous studies have focused on the health of Canadian and American truck drivers but the occupational health status of truck drivers in the Maritime Provinces remains undocumented.\\nThe objective of this cross-sectional study was to provide a general, occupational health and demographic characteristics description of professional truck drivers in the Maritimes.\\nOne-hundred and four male truck drivers from the Canadian Maritime Provinces volunteered for this study. Nine occupational health indicators were measured (seven were self-reported via questionnaire and two were physical measurements). Participants self-reported their age, years of truck driving experience and education.\\nOnly one-quarter of the current sample had no health conditions. In contrast, more than half were obese, one third had back problems, and one-sixth had a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The group comparison analysis showed that the group without health condition were younger and more educated than the group with multiple health conditions. For this study, age and low rate of education were associated with an increased number of health conditions.\\nSimilar to health profiles of other populations of North American truck drivers, this study suggests that the majority of truck drivers in the Canadian Maritime Provinces have at least one poor indicator of occupational health.\",\n",
