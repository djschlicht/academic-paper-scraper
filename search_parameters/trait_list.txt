*** Explanation of queries: 
* 	-> 'disease from disease_list' AND 'trait from trait_list'
*		- Each represents one line from it's respective list
* 	-> (For now) 1 disease and 1 trait will be paired and queried at a
*	time (to narrow focus and get more accurate results). This will be 
*	done iteratively based on the items found here and in disease_list.
*		- This part is open to experimentation, but I found that using
*		a big nest of logical groupings did not provide good results, so
*		I'm going to try the opposite and see how it works (for science).
* 	-> 'disease from disease_list' is a disjunction of comma-separated
* 	items from one line (to handle multiple names for 1 thing)
* 	-> 'trait from trait_list' includes comma-separated and parentheses- 
*	grouped items from one line.
* 		- Items INSIDE of parentheses will be a disjunction.
* 		- Items OUTSIDE of parentheses (including the groups themselves)
* 		will be a conjunction.
*		- Nested parentheses don't work well. Try to use the properties
		of boolean algebra to get around this if it's needed.
*		- The idea is to provide a means to account for flexibility 
*		of language (synonyms) while getting accurate/complete results.
* 	-> Ex. (a, b), c, d --> (a OR b) AND c AND d
**** Ideas for expansion and improvement:
* -> Organize keywords into groupings (e.g. geographic, biological, etc)
* -> Add in a 'NOT' function to negate things.
* -> Allow 'mix-n-match' using indices(?) to share frequently used terms
* -> (After Capstone,) make it available open-source. The foundation of
*	this could be adapted for other research topics.
