However, the precise timeline of the disease, \\\\\\nits transmissibility, and the efect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network \\\\\\nmodel with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States.

We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specifc, whereas \\\\\\nthe contact period is behavior-specifc and can vary between diferent provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the \\\\\\noutbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we adopted the disease-specifc values from China and found a contact period of \\\\\\n3.38 ± 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that—without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today— \\\\\\nthe United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May \\\\\\n10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics \\\\\\nand provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control.
