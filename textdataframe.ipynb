This disease\\nmainly affects the lung, but can also cause damage to the intestinal\\ntract, liver, and nervous system, with corresponding symptoms (Lu\\net al., 2020). The outbreak originated in Wuhan city, Hubei\\nProvince in December 2019, and quickly spread to provinces and\\ncities across the country and aboard (Li et al., 2020; WHO, 2020;\\nZhu et al., 2019). As of 28 August, 2020, there were 85 022\\nconfirmed cases in China, including 4634 deaths and 80 126\\nrecovered cases (China NHCotPsRo, 2020a). Human-to-human\\ntransmission of SARS-CoV-2 had been demonstrated mainly\\nthrough respiratory droplets and contact (Chan et al., 2020). The\\ncontinuing challenges of the epidemic and research progress in\\nChina have led to emergency responses from the Chinese\\ngovernment, including the issuance of regulatory documents\\n(China NHCotPsRo, 2020b; China NHCotPsRo, 2020c).\\nClinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever,\\ncough, and fatigue, and in a few cases stuffy nose, runny nose,\\nand diarrhea (China NHCotPsRo, 2020b). Severe cases result in\\nacute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and coagulopathically caused death (Huang et al., 2020). As a highly contagious\\ninfectious disease, its sources of infection include not only\\nconfirmed cases, but also asymptomatic carriers (Huang et al.,\\n2020; Cohen, 2020). Asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2\\ninfection are always without clinical symptoms, but positive for\\nthe viral nucleic acid test. Most are found during the screening of\\nclose contacts, and because the laboratory tests are performed at\\nan early stage, some asymptomatic cases go on to develop illness\\nafter screening.\\nFor this study, we conducted a follow-up study on asymptomatic carriers in Anhui Province, and analyzed the features of these\\ninfections. Our findings provide evidence for the need to modify\\nthe preventive measures.\\nMaterials and methods\\nStudy design\\nThis was a follow-up study, conducted in Anhui Province, China.\\n* Corresponding author at.

All asymptomatic\\ncarriers fulfilled the following criteria: (1) without symptoms of\\nfever, cough, and fatigue; (2) no radiographic evidence of pneumonia;(3) with normal white cell count and normal lymphocyte count;\\nand (4) positive nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2.\\nData collection\\nA questionnaire was formulated to gather data on: (1)\\ndemographic information, such as name, age, gender, and occupation; (2) clinical symptoms, including fever, chill, cough, and fatigue\\nif these developed during the 14-day observation period; (3)\\nlaboratory testing related to SARS-CoV-2 infection,including nucleic\\ntest result and timing of test; (4) close contact information, such as\\nnumbers, confirmed cases, and asymptomatic carriers.\\nLaboratory testing\\nRespiratory samples, including sputum and throat swab\\nsamples, were collected from all asymptomatic carriers by trained\\ninspection personnel. Viral RNA was extracted using a TANBead\\nnucleic acid kit (Taiwan Advanced Nanotech Inc, Taiwan, China) in\\na biosafety level-2 laboratory. Tests for the ORF1ab and N genes in\\nrespiratory samples were carried out using a 2019-nCoV dual\\nfluorescent PCR kit (Shanghai BioGerm Medical Biotechnology Co.,\\nLtd, Shanghai, China and DAAN Gene Co., Ltd, Sun Yat-sen\\nUniversity, Guangdong, China).\\nStatistical analysis\\nMicrosoft Office software (version 2019) was employed to input\\nand check the data, and SPSS software (version 11.0) was used to\\nanalyze the data. Categorical variables were summarized as\\nfrequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were\\ndescribed using medians. The frequencies of categorical variables\\nwere comparedusingthechi-square test, as appropriate.Testswitha\\np-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\nEthical statement\\nCollection of data and samples from patients was part of a\\nroutine surveillance and outbreak investigation, and was therefore\\nexempt from assessment by the institutional review board (IRB).\\nThe IRB of Anhui Provincial Center for Disease Control and\\nPrevention reviewed the study.\\nResults\\nDemographic features\\nTable 1 shows the demographic features of the 147 asymptomatic carriers. Of these, 15.6% (23/147) were under 20 years old, and\\n64.6% (95/147) were aged 20–59 years. 51.7% (76/147) of the\\ncarriers were male, and 94.6% (139/147) were found by close\\ncontact screening. A total of 16 asymptomatic carriers developed\\nsymptoms during the following 14-day observation period.\\nLatent infectivity assessment\\nThe results of our latent infectivity assessment are shown in\\nFigure 1. The latent infectivity period was evaluated using the 16\\nconfirmed cases who had transferred from being asymptomatic\\ncarriers. Two cases had tested positive 5 days before developing\\nsymptoms, one case 4 days before, three cases 3 days before, seven\\ncases 2 days before, and three cases just 1 day prior to becoming ill.\\nThe median period was calculated as 2 days (range 1–5).\\nTransmission efficiency assessment\\nA comparison of second attack rates for asymptomatic carriers\\nand confirmed cases is shown in Table 1. A total of 1150 close\\ncontacts was determined in relation to the 147 asymptomatic\\ncarriers. 47 close contacts tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection\\nduring the 14-day observation period. The 16 confirmed cases who\\nhad previously been asymptomatic accounted for 236 close\\ncontacts, with a second attack rate of 9.7%, while the remaining\\n131 asymptomatic carriers accounted for 914 close contacts, with a\\nsecond attack rate of 2.6%. There was a significant difference\\nbetween two groups (χ (Li et al., 2020) = 24.257; p < 0.001).\\nDiscussion\\nAsymptomatic infection, as part of the SARS-CoV-2 infection\\nspectrum, has been reported in a previous study (Chan et al.,\\n2020). An asymptomatic carrier is defined as someone with a\\npositive SARS-CoV-2 test from respiratory samples, including\\nsputum and throat swab, but who displays no symptoms.

Liu et al. / International Journal of Infectious Diseases 99 (2020) xxx–xxx\\nstudies have examined asymptomatic carriers and analyzed the\\nincubation period (Pan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However,\\nnone has been conducted on the assessment of transmission\\nefficiency and latent infection period with regards to asymptomatic infection. We performed this follow-up study in Anhui\\nProvince to examine these topics. Our findings could provide\\nevidence to support the revision of control measures for SARSCoV-2 infection.\\nAsymptomatic carriers can be identified in four ways. First, and\\nmost important, is active detection among close contacts. The\\nsecond is based on epidemiological investigations surrounding\\nsuspected or confirmed cases. The third involves looking at the\\nexposed population identified by tracking the SARS-CoV-2\\ninfection source. Finally, asymptomatic carriers can be found\\nthrough active surveillance in the epidemic areas. Our study\\nconfirmed that close contact screening was the main way to locate\\nasymptomatic carriers, with the same result also being reported in\\na previous study (Pan et al., 2020). This revealed that close contacts\\nidentified by screening should be isolated because they are at risk\\nof infection.\\nAccording to guidelines aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2\\ninfection, as potential infectious sources, asymptomatic\\ncarriers should be quarantined for 14 days from the first\\npositive laboratory test (China NHCotPsRo, 2020d). 10.9% of the\\nasymptomatic carriers in our study subsequently developed\\nsymptoms during the observation period to become confirmed\\ncases. Those cases occurred during the incubation period, a\\nmedian of 2 days after testing positive (range 1–5 days). Thus,\\nclose contact screening should not only focus on patients who\\nhave developed illness, but should also be extended to include\\nasymptomatic cases during the incubation period, in order to\\nreduce the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 (Hu et al., 2020). Our\\nstudy also assessed the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers. Although the attack rate was lower than that for\\nconfirmed cases, it was shown to cause infection in 2.6% of\\nclose contacts.\\nIn conclusion, although the transmission efficiency of asymptomatic carriers is lower than that for confirmed cases, the\\ntransmission risk from carriers should not be ignored. Second,\\nclose contacts of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 should undergo\\ndetailed observation and active laboratory screening, with these\\nmeasures being included in the formulating of guidelines relating\\nto SARS-CoV-2. Finally, close contact screening should be extended\\nto include those present up to 5 days before the onset of illness in\\nconfirmed cases.\\nFunding\\nThis study was supported by grants from Anhui Provincial\\nDepartment of Science and Technology, Anhui Provincial Health\\nCommission Emergency Research Project of Novel Coronavirus\\nInfection (grant numbers 202004a07020002; 202004a07020004).\\nConflicts of interest\\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe would like to thank the physicians and staff at the 16\\nmunicipal centers for Disease Control and prevention in Anhui\\nProvince for collecting the information of asymptomatic carriers of\\nSARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nReferences\\nLu R, Zhao X, Li J, Niu P, Yang B, Wu H, et al.
