"On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a global pandemic. In \
an unprecedented collective efort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and \
long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, \
its transmissibility, and the efect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network \
model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For \
the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 ± 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 ± 0.32 days, \
and an infectious period of 17.82 ± 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specifc, whereas \
the contact period is behavior-specifc and can vary between diferent provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the \
outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we adopted the disease-specifc values from China and found a contact period of \
3.38 ± 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that—without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today— \
the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May \
10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics \
and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to \
estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the efect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in \
place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole."
